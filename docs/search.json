Tidy Tuesday is a weekly social data project in R and a great way to start getting used to GitHub and building your portfolio with bitesize efforts.\nhttps://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday\nBenefits to in taking part (and in the spirit of going ‚Äúbeyond coursework‚Äù):\nexperience with tidying data\npractice generating interesting questions that you can approach with stats (harder than you think!)\npractice with data visualisation\nThere is a podcast, https://www.tidytuesday.com/and, a Slack group, r4ds.io, and even YouTube livestreams/videos.\nTo do\nCheck out previous week‚Äôs topics and work folks have done through [#TidyTuesday on Twitter‚Äô(https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TidyTuesday).\nRead the list of community guidelines so you know what to do and how to behave.\nWhen the new dataset is posted on Monday, come chat about it in the #portfolio-building channel here on Slack. If you use Twitter, follow @thomas_mock and @R4DScommunity.\nResearch opportunities\nCheck out the Department of Statistical Sciences page on research opportunities, acholarships & awards\nMy page on reading courses.\nReference letters\nYou can read more about my requirements here.\nEvery Prof is different, but it is generally good advice to make sure they know who you are. I know this can be hard or intimidating in large classes, but it can be really important. Introduce yourself, come to office hours, if there are opportunities to talk about what your interests are, take them. While you don‚Äôt want to be giving your networking elevator pitch every week in office hour, taking a bit of that networking attitude into your interactions isn‚Äôt a bad thing. I‚Äôm interested in what you‚Äôre doing and what you‚Äôre passionate about! Additionally, many reference questionnaires ask us to talk about your speaking skills. An instructor you‚Äôve never spoken to, especially in a large class, is unlikely to be able to meet with you just to see if you communicate well before deciding whether or not to write for you‚Äîthey should already have an idea of this when your request lands in their inbox!\nRohan Alexander, in a post about grad school applications, says ‚ÄúThe best letters are from folks that know you and your work. You need to spend a huge amount of effort getting decent letters. They‚Äôre as important, if not more, as your GPA.‚Äù I‚Äôd definitely recommend you check out the rest of his advice on how to think about reference letters.\nGit/GitHub skills\nSee ‚ÄòHappy Git with R‚Äô below for more information.\nBuilding a personal website\nOnce your Git & GitHub skills are sharp you‚Äôll be able to use GitHub pages to host a personal profile and portfolio for free. In summer 2021 there was a workshop series for the Independent Summer Statistics Community about this and you can access the resources here.\nIs this worth your time? I tend to think it is, as the effort of thinking about how you want to present yourself and what you value (personal brand), as well as what your brief elevator pitch/bio is, are useful and transferable to writing cover letters, personal statements and networking. Having a place where people can view your projects so that you can really demonstrate what you can do is also really valuable, and building the site with Distill for R and GitHub as a bit of a portfolio item in and of itself.\nTeamwork tips (from Google)\nBeing able to work in a team is often listed as a key skill in job ads and is an important part of many data competitions and courses your may undertake. Effective team work isn‚Äôt a given and really is a skill you can develop. And guess what? Google has spent years researching effective teamwork! They took a data-driven approach to understand how to form effective teams. ‚ÄúThe researchers found that what really mattered was less about who is on the team, and more about how the team worked together.‚Äù\nHere were some of the most important findings:\nü§∑Ô∏è Personality mix doesn‚Äôt matter\nüß† Psychological safety matters the most and you can foster it with:\nüó£Ô∏è‚ÄúEquality in conversational turn-talking‚Äù, i.e.¬†taking turns and talking an equal amount\nüëÇListening (what are your strategies for showing you‚Äôre really listening when working online? ü§î)\nI‚Äôd highly recommend taking a look at the re:work guide, it has some things you can discuss as a group and links to lots of other resources.\nOther related links:\nüì∫ Amy Edmondson‚Äôs TED Talk on psychological safety\nüì∫ The re:work YouTube channel‚Äîconsider starting with Teams, psychological safety, and Saturday Night Live by Charles Duhigg.\nüì∫ A 4 minute summary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHIikHJV9fI\nPresentations\nPut slide numbers on your slides. If you can add the total number of slides (e.g.¬†2/10) even better. This makes it easier for people to record the slide number for asking a question later.\nR user? Learn to use Xaringan and host your slides online. Easy for people to follow along (increases accessibility!) and for you to promote your work. This is also possible with Google Slides and I imagine PowerPoint online, but Xaringan is especially great for code heavy presentations, whether you‚Äôre walking people through that code or using it to create your graphs and tables, without having to re-copy and paste and reformat any time there is a change.\nPublic speaking\nPlant your feet! My drama teacher used to warn against ‚Äòhappy feet‚Äô while speaking. It can be distracting for your audience and give a sense of nervous energy. It is okay to be nervous‚ÄîI kinda love public speaking but still get nervous each and every time‚Äîbut your message is often better received if people aren‚Äôt distracted thinking ‚Äúoh poor thing, they are so nervous right now!‚Äù\nRecommended reading\nR for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham\nhttps://r4ds.had.co.nz\nIf you‚Äôve been my student I‚Äôve probably already told you about this amazing free textbook by New Zealander and rock star of the R world, Hadley Wickham (@hadleywickham).\nChapter 3 covers basics of ggplot (using the same data as Danielle Navarro does in her videos) üöó\nChapter 5 covers the basics of dplyr, a package that has saved me many hours of work when data wrangling\nüìñAnecdote time: I always recommend this book because back in NZ when one of my friends wanted to pivot from working as an organic chemist and get in to statistical consulting he worked through this book and in the space of only 2‚Äì3 months was taking on large chunks of client work for my consulting business. A fabulous crash course in being useful in R.\nHappy Git with R by Jenny Bryan, the STAT 545 TAs and Jim Hester\nhttps://happygitwithr.com/\nWhat is Git and why do you want it?\nIf you haven‚Äôt already, get yourself setup with GitHub as a key component of your portfolio building. It will supercharge your version control and your ability to collaborate with others and provides a great way to host a website on which to share your portfolio.\nI think Jenny Bryan has a great introduction in her Happy Git with R, so I‚Äôll let her explain the rest:\n\n‚ÄúGit is a version control system. Its original purpose was to help groups of developers work collaboratively on big software projects. Git manages the evolution of a set of files ‚Äì called a repository ‚Äì in a sane, highly structured way. If you have no idea what I‚Äôm talking about, think of it as the‚ÄùTrack Changes\" features from Microsoft Word on steroids.\nGit has been re-purposed by the data science community. In addition to using it for source code, we use it to manage the motley collection of files that make up typical data analytical projects, which often consist of data, figures, reports, and, yes, source code.\nA solo data analyst, working on a single computer, will benefit from adopting version control. But not nearly enough to justify the pain of installation and workflow upheaval. There are much easier ways to get versioned back ups of your files, if that‚Äôs all you‚Äôre worried about.\nIn my opinion, for new users, the pros of Git only outweigh the cons when you factor in the overhead of communicating and collaborating with other people. Who among us does not need to do that? Your life is much easier if this is baked into your workflow, as opposed to being a separate process that you dread or neglect.\"\n- Jenny Bryan, Happy Git with R, Section 1.1: Why Git? <https://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html>\n\nThere is also lots of great practical professional advice in here, too, like ‚ÄúPick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.‚Äù Save gamerangel420 for Reddit. (The first example I thought of I had to change‚Ä¶it actually was someone‚Äôs Reddit username.)\nTo do\nWork through Jenny Bryan‚Äôs awesome ‚ÄòHappy Git with R‚Äô\nSign up for the GitHub Education Student Developer Pack (access to hundreds of dollars worth of tools and training AND a GitHub pro account while you‚Äôre a student)\n\n\n\n",

We have some exciting funding and an amazing team.\nEquity, diversity and inclusion\nAs a white, settler Canadian statistician, I have a lot of learning to do about Indigenous Data Sovereignty and and decolonizing methodologies and higher education. I want Statistics to become a more equitable, diverse and inclusive discipline and seek to work with like-minded individuals to learn and take meaningful action.\nMember of the Faculty of Arts and Science Indigenous Teaching, Learning and Research Committee 2020‚Äì\nMember of the Department of Statistical Sciences EDI Committee 2021‚Äì\nDepartment liaison and instructor for the Pursue Stem program 2021‚Äì\nRead an article about Pursue STEM, featuring DoSS PhD candidate Nnenna Asidianya.\n\nInstitutional Strategic Initiatives Data Science Institute writing group for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, member, March 2021\nBuilding community among Undergraduate Statistics students: The Independent Summer Statistics Community\nFor the second summer of COVID-19, the Department of Statistical Sciences (DoSS) created a community for students in our programs of study. About 300 students signed up this summer and we had a student lead Python learning community, several awesome guest speakers, student-led workshops and we held a case competition about ‚ÄòLivable Toronto‚Äô as a chance for students to think about moving back to the city, as well as build up their portfolios and get relevant experience with data analysis, communication and teamwork. The faculty team involved is so proud of the students! We‚Äôre currently thinking about what this kind of community building looks like going forwards.\nSupporting student mental health\nI hope that the challenges of the last 16 months accelerated our progress in lasting ways when it comes to having a shared vocabulary and approaches to supporting mental health in our community. In some ways, having everything be so topsy-turvy felt like it created greater permission to bring mental health resources into the classroom in bigger ways where I think I would have been fearful of ‚Äòew this is feelings not stats‚Äô pushback from some quarters in the past.\nOther things I‚Äôve introduced over the course of the last year that I‚Äôm going to keep include making time to include wellness resources in my modules, and trying to speak to strategies I‚Äôve found helpful in my own learning journey.\nIn STA303 we created a ‚Äòreading week lite‚Äô to break up the long stretch between the real reading week and the end of semester. During this week students had a lot of choice in how they interacted with the course. They could take an almost complete break, with no new content or required quizzes, if that‚Äôs what they needed, and/or work on some revision and/or get bonus points for attending or watching the recording of two events, one on 5 Ways to Wellbeing and one Academic Resilience. This was the only time I have ever hit the 300 person Zoom cap! It was so rewarding to see that, when you put your money (or your class time and your bonus points) where your mouth is as a prof, students will really sincerely and positively engage. We‚Äôre currently looking at how to adapt this kind of programming and pacing to future courses when we‚Äôre not in the middle of a pandemic and I‚Äôve also invited mental health resource people into my STA490 class and taken up opportunities to get further training myself.\nEmpathy and well-being panel, invited speaker Center for Teaching Support & Innovation, University of Toronto (2021-02-24)\nDeveloped and delivered Initiate and Facilitate: Strategies and technology for supporting mental health and well-being in large online classes workshop with partners from FAS Mental Health Team and CTSI\nIdentify-Assist-Refer COVID training delivered by Faculty of Arts and Science Mental Health team (2020-06-12)\nLivingWorks training (2021-06-22), learning the TASC steps to recognize thoughts of suicide and engage safety resources\nStudent voice\nIn DoSS, we‚Äôre going to be continuing a pilot of a student voice initiative: the Undergraduate Consultative Committee. Interested students from participating classes could put themselves forward for a lottery to become a rep for their section. The consultative committee, which included the students the instructors and also department staff, met twice a semester with contact directly between instructors and the reps in between. This really helped the participating instructors make useful tweaks to their courses while they were in progress, instead of waiting to to have ‚Äúoh, duh!‚Äù moments when reading course evaluations after it was too late. It creates opportunities for student reps to gain leadership experience as well.\nTrauma-informed pedagogy, pedagogy for reopening\nSomething I‚Äôm in the early stages of is learning more about is trauma-informed pedagogy. I‚Äôm working with a cross-disciplinary group of faculty to build our skills and share this approach more broadly at U of T. It links to a lot of the above ideas about flexibility, student voice, community, mental health, as well as universal design principles for accessibility and I think is going to be a very important lens for us to be able to recover from the pandemic together and to improve teaching practice more generally, for the long term. Some additional key ideas include safety, trust & transparency, and awareness of cultural/historical/gender issues.\nOther things I should write more about\nHelping students become better statistical communicators, Writing Integrated Teaching Liaison\nInnovative assessments\n‚ÄòMixed assessment‚Äô timed/untimed to make large course tests more ‚Äòreal-world‚Äô\n‚ÄòExplain like I‚Äôm a‚Ä¶‚Äô presentations, communicating concepts at a range of levels\n\nExperiential learning (STA130 and STA490 collaborative projects, ASA DataFest@UofT)\nArts & Science Computational and Data Science Education Working Group, member 2020¬¨2021\nArts & Science Digital Learning Strategy Steering Committee, member, January‚ÄìMay 2021\nCensus @ School Committee member, Statistical Society of Canada (2020¬¨present)\nDepartment of Statistics Undergraduate Committee, member, ongoing\nApplied Research and Education Seminar Series (CANSSI Ontario and DoSS), committee member 2020‚Äì2021\n\n\n\n",

This course allows high achieving statistics students to expand their knowledge in an area/to a level of depth that is usually outside what is offered in other undergraduate statistics courses.\nIt can be a great opportunity to test out if you like conducting research and it can help you think about whether you‚Äôre interested in graduate level studies. It is also a good way to get a high quality reference letter (assuming things go well) for graduate school.\nCalendar description\nIndependent study under the direction of a faculty member. Students wishing to take this course must have the permission of the Department of Statistical Sciences and of the prospective supervisor. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.\nPrerequisites\nAt least 1.0 FCE 300+ level STA courses with a minimum grade of 80% in each course.\nDoing a reading course with me\nFirst and foremost, here are some key things to know about my personal policies for reading courses:\nI only supervise the Fall to Winter (‚Äòyear‚Äô-long), half credit version of this course.\nI do not supervise reading courses over the Spring/Summer semesters.\nI can only supervise a small number of students in a given year.\nYou must come up with a topic proposal in either applied statistics or statistics education to pitch to me. We will develop it together, but I want you to be interested in the topic and feel ownership of the project.\nYou must have completed STA303 and/or some form of TA/RA or other engagement (like the ISSC) with me to be eligible. Basically, when I see your application, you want for me to recognize your name.\nTopics and projects on which I‚Äôm interested in working with students\nThere are two styles of reading course you could consider:\n1. Project-based\nYou propose a topic for which data is available that you wish to apply statistical methods to and produce a report. This style of project may be useful if you‚Äôre considering a thesis-based Master‚Äôs in an applied statistics area as it lets you dip your toe in and see if you like it.\nI tend to be most interested in topics on social and economic issues, but part of the reason I am a Statistician is because I love learning new things. Convince me your topic is interesting and/or relevant to making the world a better place and if I have the right skills to support you, I‚Äôll be interested.\nI do not use a lot of Bayesian, machine learning or time series methods in my own work, and personally use R. Topics using these methods or other programming languages aren‚Äôt necessarily ruled out, but you‚Äôll need to demonstrate a plan for reasonable pre-/co-requisite courses and previous experience.\nI am also open to co-supervising with faculty from other disciplines for cross-disciplinary work.\n2. Literature and task-based\nYou choose a topic, related to one of my interest areas below, and together we create a reading and task list for your to work through across the year. You might write a literature review, prepare a workshop or talk, write blog posts, etc. This is more similar to a traditional course experience than option 1, but is an opportunity to explore a topic not covered in other statistics course, build professional skills relevant to research/future employment.\nTopics areas of interest\nethical professional practice for statisticians\nindigenous data sovereignty\nethics of web scraping\ngraphicacy and how not to lie with charts\nsampler platter of ethics topics, e.g.¬†algorithmic bias, disclosure risk, privacy/confidenitality, accessibility, reproducibility, professional codes of conduct\n\nstatistics education\nassessment practices for ethical professional practice\nteaching and learning simulation-based inference\ntrauma-informed pedagogy for statistics classrooms\nonline learning (potential data from STA130)\n\nI may consider some other topics, but the above are best aligned with my current research.\nHow register your interest\n\n\n\nSee the information on the Special Enrolment Sharepoint Page for the Department.

This page doesn‚Äôt have information about specific student projects, but should give you a sense of the kinds of skills students who completed this project will have. You may wish to skip directly to the skills description.\nOne sentence description: Students merged, wrangled, visualized, summarized and modelled data on hiring, salary and promotion to meet a client brief, and reported on their methods and findings appropriately for a general executive audience and, separately, for a technical audience.\nBut first, some context\nSTA303: Methods of Data Analysis II is a course delivered by the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto.\nIn Winter 2021 (January to April), STA303 was run completely online due to COVID-19. Students rose to this challenge remarkably well, but it was a significant challenge to wellbeing and focus, none-the-less.\nSTA303 is a communication- and application-focused course where students learn:\nto merge, wrangle, summarize and visualize data,\nabout several statistical modelling approaches and how to choose and implement these, as well as\nhow to write about their methods and results for a range of audiences.\nThe models covered include: linear mixed models, generalized linear models, generalized linear mixed models and generalized additive models.\nProject task summary\nI‚Äôve included full information on this assessment at the end of this page, but it is not needed to understand it. The project was worth 30% of students‚Äô final grades and students could choose to complete it individually or as a team. Teamwork was recommended, but the task was the same either way. Teams were not required as students had good reasons for completing individually, such as being located in a challenging time zone, lack of access to internet appropriate for calling, or other caring or work obligations that made scheduling meetings untenable.\nStudents were consulting for Black Saber Software, analyzing their hiring and employee data and tasked with creating a report appropriate for the Board of Directors on the topic of gender parity in hiring, wages and promotion. Note: Black Saber isn‚Äôt a real company, it would be massively reckless to provide 600 people with employee data with this level of detail. It would be very easy to identify individuals from data like this. That said, this dataset was simulated based on real research and employment trends and draws on my own consulting experiences.\nEach team or individual created a consulting company for the purposes of this activity and to register their group/individual status completed a pseudo-NDA, of which the only real part was reminding them that they had already agreed to several codes of conduct as part of their enrolment at U of T and made clear my expectations of their professionalism. It also gave them a chance to familiarize themselves with a common requirement for consulting.\nThe deliverable\nThe final submission was a report that included:\na cover page\nan executive summary (2 pages max)\na technical report\nconsultant bio(s) (note: these bios were meant to be ‚Äòfun‚Äô illustrations of their aspirations and interests and are not necessarily accurate), and\na company ethics statement.\nStudents were tasked to answer the research questions posed by the client, communicate their findings in ways appropriate to the audience for each section of the report, choose appropriate methods and create professional visualizations and tables to explain their results.\nReports were written in a reproducible R Markdown file (a code and text file type popular for use with the programming language R). Students were provided with a basic template that they could choose to use.\nSkills demonstrated\nStudents who completed this project to a reasonable standard can do the following (organized under broad headings):\nStatistical reasoning and knowledge\nDevelop relevant research questions that can be explored/answered statistically.\nMerge large datasets programmatically and wrangle them appropriately to create meaningful new variables, where relevant.\nChoose and create appropriate data visualizations and summaries.\nChoose appropriate statistical models and check their assumptions.\nJustify their choice of methods in writing.\nAccurately describe results, including size and direction of effect through confidence intervals, where relevant.\nIdentify and discuss strengths and limitations of their statistical approaches.\nEthical professional practice\nUnderstand and put into their own words aspects of the Statistical Society of Canada Code of Ethical Statistical Practice. (Demonstrated through the code of conduct they wrote for their ‚Äòcompany‚Äô.)\nReport findings truthfully and accurately, even when they are not what a stakeholder ‚Äòwants to hear‚Äô.\nIdentify potential sources of algorithmic bias.\nWriting\nWrite appropriately for different audiences, i.e.¬†an executive summary for executives with limited statistical knowledge and a technical report for fellow analysts (though not necessarily ones familiar with R).\nFormat a report with a logical structure.\nWork within length constraints to prioritize expressing the key information from a series of analyses.\nProgramming\nCreate reproducible code and suppress code appropriately in a final ‚Äòhuman-readable‚Äô report. I.e., no error outputs in the final PDF or raw variable names used.\nUse data wrangling and visualization functions and packages (largely dplyr and ggplot2, if that means anything to you).\nComment on and organize their code logically.\nGeneral\nConstruct and label tables and figures professionally.\nBe resilient in the face of challenges, especially when it comes to troubleshooting code bugs.\nAsk for help when they need it while also taking responsibility for their work.\nFull assessment instructions and rubric\nNote: If you‚Äôre a fellow instructor and interested in using any of this, reach out! I am happy to share originals, etc.\n‚ÄúClient‚Äù emails\nEmail 1 (text for screen readers/easier reading follows)\n\nHi,\nThanks again for the great work on the Pax Aurora project last year. I‚Äôm reaching out with another piece of work I‚Äôm hoping you can take on.\nInternally, people have been raising concerns about potential bias in our hiring and remuneration processes. I don‚Äôt think there is much to it, but I want to be able to report to the Board that we‚Äôve had external statisticians take a look and that everything is totally above board. That said, several companies in our area have had bad press about this recently, nasty complaints from staff to reporters, etc. and I want to ensure we‚Äôre out ahead of any potential issues. Obviously, I value your discretion and don‚Äôt want this mentioned more widely. NDAs will be required from anyone working on the project.\nI‚Äôll be able to provide: Hiring data for our new grad program (we have a new selection pipeline that is AI-automated up to the final interviews), and Data about promotion and salary for our entire staff. Let me know if you have any questions, and if you‚Äôre ready to get the ball rolling, please complete this NDA (docx or pdf) and submit them through our NDA portal. After that, I‚Äôll reach out with the data. Would be great if the final deliverable could have a summary targeted for the Board of Directors, as well as a more technical piece for our data team to look over as well.\nI assume same fee structure as last time applies? That will be fine on our end. Will pay hourly with a cap at 40 hours unless otherwise discussed.\nBest,\nGideon Blake\nChief People Officer | Black Saber Software\nEmail 2 (text for screen readers/easier reading follows)\n\nEmail from Gideon:\nHi again, great to know that you‚Äôre on board for this project.\nThe data team set something up for you to get the data. I‚Äôve forwarded the details they sent, see below, all the descriptions of the data are there.\nAccording to the legal team, it was better to only give you data for our current employees, so those are the only people in that data. Generally, we have a pretty good retention rate, though.\nOne of my People and Talent guys mentioned that we don‚Äôt collect data on ethnicity/race but that the team is considering it for EDI initiatives after a conference they went to, and he said it might also be related to salary. Once again, I don‚Äôt think anything like that will be an issue for us.\nThe board wants to hear that our hiring, promotion and salary processes are all fair, and based on talent and value to the company. They‚Äôre especially interested in the hiring pipeline as we‚Äôve been trialling an AI service that screens applications and then invites candidates to submit a pre-recorded video that the system rates for relevant features. Candidates are also invited to do a timed technical coding task and submit a writing sample and these are also assessed by the system. More on that in the docs, too.\nLet me know if you have any questions, looking forward to the report on April 21.\nBest,\nGideon Blake\nChief People Officer | Black Saber Software¬†\nForwarded email:\nHi G,\nThe team has prepped the documentation you asked for, the consultants can access the data by running `devtools::install_github(‚Äústa303-bolton/sta303project‚Äù)`.

You do not need to include the original data.\nOne team member will submit on behalf of the group but all members should be able to see the submission status.\n\nLate submission policy\nFor assessments in Type 1, late assessments will still be accepted through Crowdmark, but only if they are your first submission. You will lose 10 percentage points on the assessment, per day, with submissions accepted for up to 3 days after the due date. I.e., 72 hours after the initial due date.\nGrace period: Projects submitted before 8:00 p.m. ET on April 21 will have no late penalty applied.\nAccommodations and extension policy\nPlease note that as this assessment is due near the very end of the assessment period, there is limited flexibility for accommodations and extensions. While I would love to be able to otherwise, a busy final assessment period will not be sufficient reason to grant an extension.¬†\nIf you miss a type 1 assessment due to illness or a serious personal emergency, please complete¬†this formwithin ONE week of the due date of the assignment. Upon receipt of your form, we will contact you via email within 3 business days to arrange an accommodation. The sooner you can reach out, the better.\nRegrade requests\nEach member of your company must complete a declaration (download the DOCX¬†or PDF¬†version here) and submit these, along with a detailed justification in this form. See the form and declaration for full instructions.\n\n\n\n",

This was one of my favourite talks I‚Äôve ever done because I got to get creative with it. Unfortunately my use of music kept getting Rohan copyright stuck on YouTube. Sorry, Rohan!\n\n\nMy bit starts at 14:51 but I‚Äôd highly recommend the other speakers‚Äô sections!\nFellow panellists:\nNathalie Moon, Univeristy of Toronto\nMaria Tackett, Duke University\nTeon Brooks, Mozilla Firefox\nEverything you need to fall in love with Statistics, an interview with storyo.co\n2019-07-11\n\nI met Liza (pronounced Lie-zuh, like Liza Minnelli) at the R-Ladies meetup in Auckland, New Zealand where she was giving a talk on colour palettes. If you ever meet Liza, you will see that it is absolutely impossible to not get a massive positive energy recharge after talking to her. Liza is currently doing her PhD in Statistics, running a consultancy called The Data Embassy, speaking at events, teaching, mentoring. It would be my absolute pleasure to learn more about Liza and share her wonderful story.\n\nRead the full interview here\nDon‚Äôt cha wish your ggplot had colours like me?, R Ladies Auckland\n2019-06-12\nA lightning talk about using colour when plotting data with ggplot.\n\n\n\nfitvids('.shareagain', {players: 'iframe'});\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nAcademic year: 2021‚Äì22\nIn 2021-22 I will be teaching STA130 in the Fall, STA490 for the whole year and STA303 in the Winter. I am also supervising 3 students in a reading course on ethical practice.\nR is the programming language used in these courses.\nI tend to use and teach a lot of tidyverse, especially dplyr for data wrangling and ggplot for visualization.\nIf you‚Äôre not familiar with these, consider checking out:\nchapters 3 and 5 of R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham & Garret Grolemund, and\nthe DoSS Toolkit, especially the modules ‚ÄòHand me my plyrs‚Äô and To ggplot or not to ggplot.\n\n\nDelivery for STA490 and STA303 is subject to change due to the evolving pandemic situation, but all assessments will be able to be completed and submitted online. STA130 will remain online regardless as it is officially an online course.\nI cannot add students to a course, waive prerequisites or move you off a waitlist. Please reach out to the UG stats team (ug.statistics@utoronto.ca) about questions of this nature.\nThere will be ways for waitlisted STA130 & STA303 students to access course materials before the enrolment window closes, but you will not be able to complete assessments in this time. Both courses are designed to accommodate this.\n\nFind my latest autoresponder message post for FAQs and other useful information.\nPlease note that while I try to ensure this page is accurate and up-to-date, it is in no way official. ACORN, official time table information and communications from the Department or Faculty are the most accurate sources of information. If they conflict with what is written here, believe them.\nCourse\n\nDelivery\nAssessment\nNotes\nSTA130: An Introduction to Statistical Reasoning and Data Science\nF\nOnline synchronous for lectures and tutorials.\nAll assessments will be completed and submitted online.\nThe timetable may say I‚Äôm teaching section L0201, but Prof.¬†Sam Caetano and I are co-teaching both sections.\nThis course is flipped, where students watch videos and access resources at times convenient to them, before engaging in a synchronous class (or watching the recording of it).\nSTA490: Statistical Consultation, Communication, and Collaboration\nY\nOnline synchronous for lectures. Choice between online synchronous and in-person synchronous for Tuesday project meetings.\nAll assessments will be completed and submitted online.\nThis course is required for the Methods and Practice specialist and there is often limited or no places for folks outside that POSt.\nSynchronous attendance at Tuesday and Thursday (online) meetings is graded.\nThis course has special enrolment requirements.

Choice between online synchronous and in-person synchronous for tutorials.\nAll assessments will be completed and submitted online.\nI am teaching both sections (L0101 and L0201)\nThis course is likely to have flipped components, where students can watch videos and access resources at times convenient to them. Expect to have work to do before classes on Wednesdays to prepare.\nIf you can‚Äôt enrol for an online tutorial because they are full, but you would prefer to meet online, this will likely be able to be accommodated.
