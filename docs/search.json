This course allows high achieving statistics students to expand their knowledge in an area/to a level of depth that is usually outside what is offered in other undergraduate statistics courses.\nIt can be a great opportunity to test out if you like conducting research and it can help you think about whether you’re interested in graduate level studies. It is also a good way to get a high quality reference letter (assuming things go well) for graduate school.\nCalendar description\nIndependent study under the direction of a faculty member. Students wishing to take this course must have the permission of the Department of Statistical Sciences and of the prospective supervisor. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.\nPrerequisite\nAt least 1.0 FCE 300+ level STA courses with a minimum grade of 80% in each course.\nDoing a reading course with me\nFirst and foremost, here are some key things to know about my personal policies for reading courses:\nI only supervise the Fall to Winter (‘year’-long), half credit version of this course.\nI do not supervise reading courses over the Spring/Summer semesters.\nI can only supervise a small number of students in a given year.\nYou must come up with their own topic proposal in either applied statistics or statistics education to pitch to me.\nYou must have completed STA303 and/or some form of TA/RA or other engagement (like the ISSC) with me to be eligible. Basically, when I see your application, you want for me to recognize your name.\nMore information about applications coming soon.\nPrevious students\nThis section is still being developed.\nSamantha Pierre, 2020–21\nTitle: And the nominees are…An empirical study of the effects of a Tony Award Win and Nomination on a Show’s Success\nYou can hear Sam discuss the results of her project and her experience undertaking a reading course in her invited talk at the Toronto Data Workshop in May 2021.\n\n\nFollow Sam on Twitter, @WhamBamGAM.\nOther\nProf. Rohan Alexander has written up two of the reading courses he’s offered and provided the details on his website.\nEthics and Data Science\nNatural Language Processing\n\n\n\n",

Be prepared for this and start thinking about it early. You should also always ask first, before you put someone’s name down. This is also true for job reference etiquette generally.\nMy policy is not to agree to write a reference for students if they have not completed a course with me.\nTo be able to write a reference that would actually strengthen your application, AND to have fair criteria considering that I get easily 100—150 requests per year and can usually only write for about 20–25 students (I know that sounds small…but it still takes a whole work week of time), my usual minimum criteria is at least two out of the following activities with me:\nactive on Piazza/office hours + good mark in a standard class-based course (like STA303),\nstudent representative role,\nRA work,\nTA work\na reading course.\nSome examples from 2020/21 of students I said yes to:\nseveral students who had high marks in STA303 and were active and doing well in STA490 with me,\nstudents who had done STA303 and gone on to do great work as TAs or peer mentors for STA130 when I was teaching, and\na student who had done STA303 and was working on a reading course with me.\nWhat should you do if you think you fit my criteria?\nCOMING SOON\nFurther things to keep in mind:\nI need at least 3 week’s notice before your reference is due.\nI will write in support of 3 programs per student.\nComplete this form [not live yet]\nReferences for other things?\nThis will be on a bit more of a case-by-case basis. I really do want to support as many of you as I can! Email me directly to discuss jobs/scholarships/internships etc. Please keep in mind, if all I can say about you is that “Student X took my course and got grade Y”, I’m not going to be very useful to you.\nPlease also note that you should also always ask first, before you put someone’s name down.\n\n\n\n",
