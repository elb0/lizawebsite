Tidy Tuesday is a weekly social\ndata project in R and a great way to start getting used to GitHub and\nbuilding your portfolio with bitesize efforts.\nhttps://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday\nBenefits to in taking part (and in the spirit of going ‚Äúbeyond\ncoursework‚Äù):\nexperience with tidying data\npractice generating interesting questions that you can approach\nwith stats (harder than you think!)\npractice with data visualisation\nThere is a podcast, https://www.tidytuesday.com/and, a Slack group, r4ds.io, and even YouTube\nlivestreams/videos.\nTo do\nCheck out previous week‚Äôs topics and work folks have done through #TidyTuesday on\nTwitter‚Äô.\nRead the list of community\nguidelines so you know what to do and how to behave.\nWhen the new dataset is posted on Monday, come chat about it in the\n#portfolio-building channel here on Slack. If you use Twitter, follow\n@thomas_mock and\n@R4DScommunity.\nResearch opportunities\nCheck out the Department\nof Statistical Sciences page on research opportunities, acholarships\n& awards\nMy page\non reading courses.\nReference letters\nYou can read more about my requirements here.\nEvery Prof is different, but it is generally good advice to\nmake sure they know who you are. I know this can be\nhard or intimidating in large classes, but it can be really important.\nIntroduce yourself, come to office\nhours, if there are opportunities to talk about what your\ninterests are, take them. While you don‚Äôt want to be giving your\nnetworking elevator pitch every week in office hour, taking a bit of\nthat networking attitude into your interactions isn‚Äôt a bad thing. I‚Äôm\ninterested in what you‚Äôre doing and what you‚Äôre passionate about!\nAdditionally, many reference questionnaires ask us to talk about your\nspeaking skills. An instructor you‚Äôve never spoken to, especially in a\nlarge class, is unlikely to be able to meet with you just to see if you\ncommunicate well before deciding whether or not to write for you‚Äîthey\nshould already have an idea of this when your request lands in their\ninbox!\nRohan Alexander, in a post\nabout grad school applications, says ‚ÄúThe best letters are from\nfolks that know you and your work. You need to spend a huge amount of\neffort getting decent letters. They‚Äôre as important, if not more, as\nyour GPA.‚Äù I‚Äôd definitely recommend you check out the rest of his advice\non how to think about reference letters.\nMSc in Statistics at U of T\nYou can read more about admission to the MSc in Statistics here.\nKey details (at time of writing): Submit your online application for our Master of Science (MSc)\nprogram between Sep 22 and Jan 22¬†each\nyear. The deadline for supporting documents is Jan 31.\nAll online applications and supporting documents should be submitted\nthrough the School\nof Graduate Studies Online Application Portal. We will begin sending\nout letters of offer in March.\nOther useful resources\nThe U of T\nassignment calculator also has options to break writing a personal\nstatement and graduate school applications more generally into steps,\nwith lots of advice and helpful links!\nChapnick, A. (2009-03-09). How\nto ask for a reference letter. University Affairs.\nAlexander, R. (2021-03-12). Saturday\nmorning thoughts on grad school applications.\nGit/GitHub skills\nSee ‚ÄòHappy Git with R‚Äô below for more\ninformation.\nBuilding a personal website\nOnce your Git & GitHub skills are sharp\nyou‚Äôll be able to use GitHub pages to host a personal profile and\nportfolio for free. In summer 2021 there was a workshop series for the\nIndependent Summer Statistics Community about this and you can\naccess the resources here.\nIs this worth your time? I tend to think it is, as\nthe effort of thinking about how you want to present yourself and what\nyou value (personal brand), as well as what your brief elevator\npitch/bio is, are useful and transferable to writing cover letters,\npersonal statements and networking. Having a place where people can view\nyour projects so that you can really demonstrate what you can do is also\nreally valuable, and building the site with Distill for R and GitHub as\na bit of a portfolio item in and of itself.\nTeamwork tips (from Google)\nBeing able to work in a team is often listed as a key skill in job\nads and is an important part of many data competitions and courses your\nmay undertake. Effective team work isn‚Äôt a given and really is a skill\nyou can develop. And guess what? Google has spent years researching\neffective teamwork! They took a data-driven approach to understand how\nto form effective teams. ‚ÄúThe researchers found that what really\nmattered was less about who is on the team, and more about how the team\nworked together.‚Äù\nHere were some of the most important findings:\nü§∑Ô∏è Personality mix doesn‚Äôt matter\nüß† Psychological safety matters the most and you can foster it\nwith:\nüó£Ô∏è‚ÄúEquality in conversational turn-talking‚Äù, i.e.¬†taking turns and\ntalking an equal amount\nüëÇListening (what are your strategies for showing you‚Äôre really\nlistening when working online? ü§î)\nI‚Äôd highly recommend taking a look at the re:work\nguide, it has some things you can discuss as a group and links to\nlots of other resources.\nOther related links:\nüì∫ Amy Edmondson‚Äôs TED Talk on\npsychological safety\nüì∫ The\nre:work YouTube channel‚Äîconsider starting with Teams,\npsychological safety, and Saturday Night Live by Charles\nDuhigg.\nüì∫ A 4 minute summary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHIikHJV9fI\nPresentations\nPut slide numbers on your slides. If you can add\nthe total number of slides (e.g.¬†2/10) even better. This makes it easier\nfor people to record the slide number for asking a question\nlater.\nR user? Learn to use Xaringan\nand host your slides online. Easy for people to follow along (increases\naccessibility!) and for you to promote your work. This is also possible\nwith Google Slides and I imagine PowerPoint online, but Xaringan is\nespecially great for code heavy presentations, whether you‚Äôre walking\npeople through that code or using it to create your graphs and tables,\nwithout having to re-copy and paste and reformat any time there is a\nchange.\nPublic speaking\nPlant your feet! My drama teacher used to warn against ‚Äòhappy feet‚Äô\nwhile speaking. It can be distracting for your audience and give a sense\nof nervous energy. It is okay to be nervous‚ÄîI kinda love public speaking\nbut still get nervous each and every time‚Äîbut your message is often\nbetter received if people aren‚Äôt distracted thinking ‚Äúoh poor thing,\nthey are so nervous right now!‚Äù\nRecommended reading\nR\nfor Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham\nhttps://r4ds.had.co.nz\nIf you‚Äôve been my student I‚Äôve probably already told you about this\namazing free textbook by New Zealander and rock star of the R world,\nHadley Wickham (@hadleywickham).\nChapter\n3 covers basics of ggplot (using the same data as Danielle Navarro\ndoes in her videos) üöó\nChapter 5 covers\nthe basics of dplyr, a package that has saved me many hours of work when\ndata wrangling\nüìñAnecdote time: I always recommend this book because back in NZ when\none of my friends wanted to pivot from working as an organic chemist and\nget in to statistical consulting he worked through this book and in the\nspace of only 2‚Äì3 months was taking on large chunks of client work for\nmy consulting business. A fabulous crash course in being useful in\nR.\nHappy Git with R by Jenny Bryan, the STAT 545\nTAs and Jim Hester\nhttps://happygitwithr.com/\nWhat is Git and why do you\nwant it?\nIf you haven‚Äôt already, get yourself setup with GitHub as a key\ncomponent of your portfolio building. It will supercharge your version\ncontrol and your ability to collaborate with others and provides a great\nway to host a website on which to share your portfolio.\nI think Jenny Bryan has a great introduction in her Happy Git with R,\nso I‚Äôll let her explain the rest:\n\n‚ÄúGit is a version control system. Its original purpose was to help\ngroups of developers work collaboratively on big software projects. Git\nmanages the evolution of a set of files ‚Äì called a repository ‚Äì in a\nsane, highly structured way. If you have no idea what I‚Äôm talking about,\nthink of it as the‚ÄùTrack Changes‚Äù features from Microsoft Word on\nsteroids.\nGit has been re-purposed by the data science community. In addition\nto using it for source code, we use it to manage the motley collection\nof files that make up typical data analytical projects, which often\nconsist of data, figures, reports, and, yes, source code.\nA solo data analyst, working on a single computer, will benefit from\nadopting version control. But not nearly enough to justify the pain of\ninstallation and workflow upheaval. There are much easier ways to get\nversioned back ups of your files, if that‚Äôs all you‚Äôre worried\nabout.\nIn my opinion, for new users, the pros of Git only outweigh the cons\nwhen you factor in the overhead of communicating and collaborating with\nother people. Who among us does not need to do that? Your life is much\neasier if this is baked into your workflow, as opposed to being a\nseparate process that you dread or neglect.‚Äù\n- Jenny Bryan, Happy Git with R, Section 1.1: Why Git? <https://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html>\n\nThere is also lots of great practical professional advice in here,\ntoo, like ‚ÄúPick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your\nfuture boss.‚Äù Save gamerangel420 for Reddit. (The first example I\nthought of I had to change‚Ä¶it actually was someone‚Äôs Reddit\nusername.)\nTo do\nWork through Jenny Bryan‚Äôs awesome ‚ÄòHappy Git with R‚Äô\nSign up for the GitHub Education Student\nDeveloper Pack (access to hundreds of dollars worth of tools and\ntraining AND a GitHub pro account while you‚Äôre a student)\n\n\n\n",

Basically, a\ngood mark in one class is not sufficient for me to be able to\nwrite a letter that will strengthen your application. ‚ÄúWhy yes,\naccording to their transcript this student did take my course‚Äù\nisn‚Äôt a very inspiring recommendation. My basic criteria is that you\nneed to have at least two distinct ‚Äòactivities‚Äô with\nme. If you believe you meet this basic criteria, you can\nrequest a reference from me here. I will then\naccept or decline based on the information provided.\n2022-23 teaching & supervision\nI will be teaching the Winter semester of STA490 this year. I\nwill not be teaching STA130 or STA303. You can find Winter 2022 STA303\nresources here,\nbut please note that the course is likely to be improved and run\ndifferently by its next instructor.\nI will not be supervising any reading courses,\nbut highly recommend strong final year students look into them.

See here for\nclient emails, other info, and how to get the data (see bottom of\npage).\n2022: Consulting for fake company MINGAR, analyzing customer data\nfor their Canadian fitness tracker/watch market and investigating a\nconcern about poorer product performance for users with darker skin.\nThis project also includes some modern data skills, like accessing an\nAPI to retrieve a large volume of data, scraping a table from a website\ninto a usable dataset and using a licensed postal code conversion file\nfor data linkage. See the client\nemail and general\ninfo (Step 5 might be most helpful), and access the data and\ntemplate on JupyterHub\n(U of T only) or GitHub.\n\nI also always recommend TidyTuesday\ndatasets and you may find Chapter 4 of Building\na Career in Data Science interesting (the authors have made it\navailable for free on that website).\n\nMasters/PhDs: I am not taking on Masters or PhD\nstudents. Please see the graduate section of our Department website for\nmore information: https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/graduate.\nProspective PhD students, all applications are made through a central\nportal,¬†you don‚Äôt (to my knowledge) need a sponsoring faculty\nmember, but can check out the team here.\nYou will be¬†able to select up to three potential supervisors at the time\nof your application (but again note that I‚Äôm not taking on\nstudents).\n\nDoing okay?

We have some exciting funding and an amazing\nteam.\nEquity, diversity and\ninclusion\nAs a white, settler Canadian statistician, I have a lot of learning\nto do about Indigenous Data Sovereignty and and decolonizing\nmethodologies and higher education. I want Statistics to become a more\nequitable, diverse and inclusive discipline and seek to work with\nlike-minded individuals to learn and take meaningful action.\nMember of the Faculty of Arts and Science Indigenous Teaching,\nLearning and Research Committee 2020‚Äì\nMember of the Department of Statistical Sciences EDI Committee\n2021‚Äì\nDepartment liaison and instructor for the Pursue Stem program\n2021‚Äì\nRead\nan article about Pursue STEM, featuring DoSS PhD candidate Nnenna\nAsidianya.\n\nInstitutional Strategic Initiatives Data Science Institute\nwriting group for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, member, March\n2021\nBuilding\ncommunity among Undergraduate Statistics students: The Independent\nSummer Statistics Community\nFor the second summer of COVID-19, the Department of Statistical\nSciences (DoSS) created a community for students in our programs of\nstudy. About 300 students signed up this summer and we had a student\nlead Python learning community, several awesome guest speakers,\nstudent-led workshops and we held a case competition about ‚ÄòLivable\nToronto‚Äô as a chance for students to think about moving back to the\ncity, as well as build up their portfolios and get relevant experience\nwith data analysis, communication and teamwork. The faculty team\ninvolved is so proud of the students! We‚Äôre currently thinking about\nwhat this kind of community building looks like going forwards.\nSupporting student mental\nhealth\nI hope that the challenges of the last 16 months accelerated our\nprogress in lasting ways when it comes to having a shared vocabulary and\napproaches to supporting mental health in our community. In some ways,\nhaving everything be so topsy-turvy felt like it created greater\npermission to bring mental health resources into the classroom in bigger\nways where I think I would have been fearful of ‚Äòew this is feelings not\nstats‚Äô pushback from some quarters in the past.\nOther things I‚Äôve introduced over the course of the last year that\nI‚Äôm going to keep include making time to include wellness resources in\nmy modules, and trying to speak to strategies I‚Äôve found helpful in my\nown learning journey.\nIn STA303 we created a ‚Äòreading week lite‚Äô to break up the long\nstretch between the real reading week and the end of semester. During\nthis week students had a lot of choice in how they interacted with the\ncourse. They could take an almost complete break, with no new content or\nrequired quizzes, if that‚Äôs what they needed, and/or work on some\nrevision and/or get bonus points for attending or watching the recording\nof two events, one on 5 Ways to Wellbeing and one Academic Resilience.\nThis was the only time I have ever hit the 300 person Zoom cap! It was\nso rewarding to see that, when you put your money (or your class time\nand your bonus points) where your mouth is as a prof, students will\nreally sincerely and positively engage. We‚Äôre currently looking at how\nto adapt this kind of programming and pacing to future courses when\nwe‚Äôre not in the middle of a pandemic and I‚Äôve also invited mental\nhealth resource people into my STA490 class and taken up opportunities\nto get further training myself.\nEmpathy and well-being panel, invited speaker Center for Teaching\nSupport & Innovation, University of Toronto (2021-02-24)\nDeveloped and delivered Initiate and Facilitate: Strategies and\ntechnology for supporting mental health and well-being in large online\nclasses workshop with partners from FAS Mental Health Team and\nCTSI\nIdentify-Assist-Refer COVID training delivered by Faculty of Arts\nand Science Mental Health team (2020-06-12)\nLivingWorks training (2021-06-22), learning the TASC steps to\nrecognize thoughts of suicide and engage safety resources\nStudent voice\nIn DoSS, we‚Äôre going to be continuing a pilot of a student voice\ninitiative: the Undergraduate Consultative Committee. Interested\nstudents from participating classes could put themselves forward for a\nlottery to become a rep for their section. The consultative committee,\nwhich included the students the instructors and also department staff,\nmet twice a semester with contact directly between instructors and the\nreps in between. This really helped the participating instructors make\nuseful tweaks to their courses while they were in progress, instead of\nwaiting to to have ‚Äúoh, duh!‚Äù moments when reading course evaluations\nafter it was too late. It creates opportunities for student reps to gain\nleadership experience as well.\nTrauma-informed\npedagogy, pedagogy for reopening\nSomething I‚Äôm in the early stages of is learning more about is\ntrauma-informed pedagogy. I‚Äôm working with a cross-disciplinary group of\nfaculty to build our skills and share this approach more broadly at U of\nT. It links to a lot of the above ideas about flexibility, student\nvoice, community, mental health, as well as universal design principles\nfor accessibility and I think is going to be a very important lens for\nus to be able to recover from the pandemic together and to improve\nteaching practice more generally, for the long term. Some additional key\nideas include safety, trust & transparency, and awareness of\ncultural/historical/gender issues.\nOther things I should\nwrite more about\nHelping students become better statistical communicators, Writing\nIntegrated Teaching Liaison\nInnovative assessments\n‚ÄòMixed assessment‚Äô timed/untimed to make large course tests more\n‚Äòreal-world‚Äô\n‚ÄòExplain like I‚Äôm a‚Ä¶‚Äô presentations, communicating concepts at a\nrange of levels\n\nExperiential learning (STA130 and STA490 collaborative projects,\nASA DataFest@UofT)\nArts & Science Computational and Data Science Education\nWorking Group, member 2020¬¨2021\nArts & Science Digital Learning Strategy Steering Committee,\nmember, January‚ÄìMay 2021\nCensus @ School Committee member, Statistical Society of Canada\n(2020¬¨present)\nDepartment of Statistics Undergraduate Committee, member,\nongoing\nApplied Research and Education Seminar Series (CANSSI Ontario and\nDoSS), committee member 2020‚Äì2021\n\n\n\n",

This course allows high achieving statistics\nstudents to expand their knowledge in an area/to a level of depth that\nis usually outside what is offered in other undergraduate statistics\ncourses.\nIt can be a great opportunity to test out if you like conducting\nresearch and it can help you think about whether you‚Äôre interested in\ngraduate level studies. It is also a good way to get a high quality reference letter\n(assuming things go well) for graduate school.\nCalendar description\nIndependent study under the direction of a faculty member.\nStudents wishing to take this course must have the permission of the\nDepartment of Statistical Sciences and of the prospective supervisor.\nNot eligible for CR/NCR option.\nPrerequisites\nAt least 1.0 FCE 300+ level STA courses with a minimum grade of 80%\nin each course.\nDoing a reading course with\nme\nFirst and foremost, here are some key things to know about my\npersonal policies for reading courses:\nI only supervise the Fall to Winter (‚Äòyear‚Äô-long), half credit\nversion of this course.\nI do not supervise reading courses over the Spring/Summer\nsemesters.\nI can only supervise a small number of students in a given\nyear.\nYou must come up with a topic proposal in either applied\nstatistics or statistics education to pitch to\nme. We will develop it together, but I want you to be interested in the\ntopic and feel ownership of the project.\nYou must have completed STA303 and/or some form of TA/RA or other\nengagement (like the ISSC) with me to be eligible. Basically, when I see\nyour application, you want for me to recognize your name.\nTopics\nand projects on which I‚Äôm interested in working with students\nThere are two styles of reading course you could consider:\n1. Project-based\nYou propose a topic for which data is available that you wish to\napply statistical methods to and produce a report. This style of project\nmay be useful if you‚Äôre considering a thesis-based Master‚Äôs in an\napplied statistics area as it lets you dip your toe in and see if you\nlike it.\nI tend to be most interested in topics on social and economic issues,\nbut part of the reason I am a Statistician is because I love learning\nnew things. Convince me your topic is interesting and/or relevant to\nmaking the world a better place and if I have the right skills to\nsupport you, I‚Äôll be interested.\nI do not use a lot of Bayesian, machine learning or time\nseries methods in my own work, and personally use R. Topics using these\nmethods or other programming languages aren‚Äôt necessarily ruled out, but\nyou‚Äôll need to demonstrate a plan for reasonable pre-/co-requisite\ncourses and previous experience.\nI am also open to co-supervising with faculty from\nother disciplines for cross-disciplinary work.\n2. Literature and task-based\nYou choose a topic, related to one of my interest areas below, and\ntogether we create a reading and task list for your to work through\nacross the year. You might write a literature review, prepare a workshop\nor talk, write blog posts, etc. This is more similar to a traditional\ncourse experience than option 1, but is an opportunity to explore a\ntopic not covered in other statistics course, build professional skills\nrelevant to research/future employment.\nTopics areas of interest\nethical professional practice for statisticians\nindigenous data sovereignty\nethics of web scraping\ngraphicacy and how not to lie with charts\nsampler platter of ethics topics, e.g.¬†algorithmic bias,\ndisclosure risk, privacy/confidenitality, accessibility,\nreproducibility, professional codes of conduct\n\nstatistics education\nassessment practices for ethical professional practice\nteaching and learning simulation-based inference\ntrauma-informed pedagogy for statistics classrooms\nonline learning (potential data from STA130)\n\nI may consider some other topics, but the above are best aligned\nwith my current research.\nHow register your interest\n\n\n\nSee the information on the Special\nEnrolment Sharepoint Page for the Department.

This is also true\nfor job reference etiquette generally.\nMy policy is not to agree to write a reference for students if they\nhave not completed a course with me.\nTo be able to write a reference that would actually strengthen your\napplication, AND to have fair criteria considering that I get easily\n100‚Äî150 requests per year and can usually only write for about 20‚Äì25\nstudents (I know that sounds small‚Ä¶but it still takes a whole work week\nof time), my usual minimum criteria is at least two out of the following\nactivities with me:\nactive on Piazza/office hours + good mark in a standard class-based\ncourse (like STA303) [PLEAE NOTE, all of this counts as ONE activity and\none course is not enough by itself unless I have told you\notherwise],\nstudent representative role,\nRA work,\nTA work\na reading course.\nSome examples of students I have said yes to:\nseveral students who had high marks in STA303 and were active and\ndoing well in STA490 with me,\nstudents who had done STA303 and gone on to do great work as TAs or\npeer mentors for STA130 when I was teaching, and\na student who had done STA303 and was working on a reading course\nwith me.\nFurther things to keep in mind:\nI need at least 3‚Äì5 week‚Äôs notice before your reference is\ndue.\nI will write in support of 3 programs per student.\nI will only agree if I can write you a strong letter.\nAnything less is a waste of your and my time. Example of things I am\nfrequently asked to rate about students that a good grade alone won‚Äôt\ntell me:\nClarity of Goals for Graduate Study\nOral Expression in English\nAbility to Work Independently\nAbility to Work with Others\nResearch Potential\nMotivation\n‚ÄúHumility‚Äù and ‚Äúsense of humour‚Äù are other examples that I\npersonally hate, but your chosen program(s) might ask.\n\nIf offered (i.e., if there is a tick box), please waive\nyour right to access the report. (You can ask me directly if I\nam comfortable sharing it with you.) This is usually just for American\nschools, you can read more here.\nDON‚ÄôT offer to write a draft for me (I don‚Äôt accept this, and\nschools may ask you to declare something like ‚ÄúI confirm that I will not\nwrite any portion of this evaluation, nor will I have any involvement in\nits drafting or submission.‚Äù anyways), DO provide lots of specific\ndetails, examples and relevant files when completing the request form or\nsubsequent details form (there is a second form if I approve you first\nrequest). Tell me enough that I could approve/write this even if I got\npartial amnesia.\nWhat should\nyou do if you think you fit my criteria?\nIf you believe you meet my\nbasic criteria, you can request a reference from me here. I will\nthen accept or decline based on the the information provided.\nIndustry\nthen grad school? How to ask about references for a few years\nfrom now\nSeveral students have very sensibly asked what they should do if they\nplan to work for a year or two before grad school. A great question and\nmy attempt to provide some clarity below.\nSo firstly, the ‚Äòtwo activity criterion‚Äô (from above) still applies,\nbut you don‚Äôt need to fill out the form now.\nWhat you should do now:\nIFF (if and only if) you meet my criteria, let me know that this\nis what you‚Äôre considering. Do it via email so a few\nyears from now when you ask and I search your name, I‚Äôll have a record\nof the conversation.\nCreate a folder/document with notes about the things I might know\nabout you.\nSave copies of any assignments you‚Äôre particularly proud of (like a\nSTA130/STA303/STA490 final project) and make note of whether you did it\nas a group, what the grade you got was etc. Don‚Äôt assume future you will\nremember this. Future me definitely won‚Äôt!\n\nWhat you should\ndo when you‚Äôre planning to apply:\nMake sure you plan ahead and get a sense of the deadlines from\nprograms you are interested in. Aim to get back in touch with me (see\nnext point) 5‚Äì6 weeks before your first due date.\nCheck back on this page to see what my request instructions are\n(i.e., there is currently a request form linked above) and follow any\ninstructions provided. This is where your notes will come in handy! You\ncan even add a link to the folder (make sure it is not password\nprotected) as part of the request.\nGeneral tips and advice\nSee my general advice here.\nReferences for other things?\nThis will be on a bit more of a case-by-case basis. I really do want\nto support as many of you as I can! Email me directly to discuss\njobs/scholarships/internships etc. Please keep in mind, if all I\ncan say about you is that ‚ÄúStudent X took my course and got grade Y‚Äù,\nI‚Äôm not going to be very useful to you.\nPlease also note that you should also always ask first, before you\nput someone‚Äôs name down.\n\n\n\n",

This page doesn‚Äôt have information about\nspecific student projects, but should give you a sense of the kinds of\nskills students who completed this project will have. You may wish to skip directly to the skills description.\nOne sentence description: Students merged,\nwrangled, visualized, summarized and modelled data on hiring, salary and\npromotion to meet a client brief, and reported on their methods and\nfindings appropriately for a general executive audience and, separately,\nfor a technical audience.\nBut first, some context\nSTA303: Methods of Data Analysis II is a course delivered by\nthe Department of\nStatistical Sciences at the University of Toronto.\nIn Winter 2021 (January to April), STA303 was run completely online\ndue to COVID-19. Students rose to this challenge remarkably well, but it\nwas a significant challenge to wellbeing and focus, none-the-less.\nSTA303 is a communication- and application-focused course where\nstudents learn:\nto merge, wrangle, summarize and visualize data,\nabout several statistical modelling approaches and how to choose\nand implement these, as well as\nhow to write about their methods and results for a range of\naudiences.\nThe models covered include: linear mixed models, generalized linear\nmodels, generalized linear mixed models and generalized additive\nmodels.\nProject task summary\nI‚Äôve included full information on this assessment at the end of this\npage, but it is not needed to understand it. The project was worth 30%\nof students‚Äô final grades and students could choose to complete it\nindividually or as a team. Teamwork was recommended,\nbut the task was the same either way. Teams were not required as\nstudents had good reasons for completing individually, such as being\nlocated in a challenging time zone, lack of access to internet\nappropriate for calling, or other caring or work obligations that made\nscheduling meetings untenable.\nStudents were consulting for Black Saber Software, analyzing their\nhiring and employee data and tasked with creating a report\nappropriate for the Board of Directors on the topic of gender parity in\nhiring, wages and promotion. Note: Black Saber isn‚Äôt a real\ncompany, it would be massively reckless to provide 600 people with\nemployee data with this level of detail. It would be very easy to\nidentify individuals from data like this. That said, this dataset was\nsimulated based on real research and employment trends and draws on my\nown consulting experiences.\nEach team or individual created a consulting company for the purposes\nof this activity and to register their group/individual status completed\na pseudo-NDA, of which the only real part was reminding them that they\nhad already agreed to several codes of conduct as part of their\nenrolment at U of T and made clear my expectations of their\nprofessionalism. It also gave them a chance to familiarize themselves\nwith a common requirement for consulting.\nThe deliverable\nThe final submission was a report that included:\na cover page\nan executive summary (2 pages max)\na technical report\nconsultant bio(s) (note: these bios were meant to be ‚Äòfun‚Äô\nillustrations of their aspirations and interests and are not necessarily\naccurate), and\na company ethics statement.\nStudents were tasked to answer the research questions posed by the\nclient, communicate their findings in ways appropriate to the audience\nfor each section of the report, choose appropriate methods and create\nprofessional visualizations and tables to explain their results.\nReports were written in a reproducible R Markdown file (a code and\ntext file type popular for use with the programming language R).\nStudents were provided with a basic template that they could choose to\nuse.\nSkills demonstrated\nStudents who completed this project to a reasonable standard can do\nthe following (organized under broad headings):\nStatistical reasoning and\nknowledge\nDevelop relevant research questions that can be explored/answered\nstatistically.\nMerge large datasets programmatically and wrangle them\nappropriately to create meaningful new variables, where\nrelevant.\nChoose and create appropriate data visualizations and\nsummaries.\nChoose appropriate statistical models and check their\nassumptions.\nJustify their choice of methods in writing.\nAccurately describe results, including size and direction of\neffect through confidence intervals, where relevant.\nIdentify and discuss strengths and limitations of their\nstatistical approaches.\nEthical professional\npractice\nUnderstand and put into their own words aspects of the Statistical\nSociety of Canada Code of Ethical Statistical Practice.\n(Demonstrated through the code of conduct they wrote for their\n‚Äòcompany‚Äô.)\nReport findings truthfully and accurately, even when they are not\nwhat a stakeholder ‚Äòwants to hear‚Äô.\nIdentify potential sources of algorithmic bias.\nWriting\nWrite appropriately for different audiences, i.e.¬†an executive\nsummary for executives with limited statistical knowledge and a\ntechnical report for fellow analysts (though not necessarily ones\nfamiliar with R).\nFormat a report with a logical structure.\nWork within length constraints to prioritize expressing the key\ninformation from a series of analyses.\nProgramming\nCreate reproducible code and suppress code appropriately in a\nfinal ‚Äòhuman-readable‚Äô report. I.e., no error outputs in the final PDF\nor raw variable names used.\nUse data wrangling and visualization functions and packages\n(largely dplyr and ggplot2, if that means anything to you).\nComment on and organize their code logically.\nGeneral\nConstruct and label tables and figures professionally.\nBe resilient in the face of challenges, especially when it comes\nto troubleshooting code bugs.\nAsk for help when they need it while also taking responsibility\nfor their work.\nFull assessment\ninstructions and rubric\nNote: If you‚Äôre a fellow instructor and interested in using any of\nthis, reach out! I am happy to share originals, etc.\n‚ÄúClient‚Äù emails\nEmail 1\n(text for screen readers/easier reading follows)\n\nHi,\nThanks again for the great work on the Pax Aurora project last year.\nI‚Äôm reaching out with another piece of work I‚Äôm hoping you can take\non.\nInternally, people have been raising concerns about potential bias in\nour hiring and remuneration processes. I don‚Äôt think there is much to\nit, but I want to be able to report to the Board that we‚Äôve had external\nstatisticians take a look and that everything is totally above board.\nThat said, several companies in our area have had bad press about this\nrecently, nasty complaints from staff to reporters, etc. and I want to\nensure we‚Äôre out ahead of any potential issues. Obviously, I value your\ndiscretion and don‚Äôt want this mentioned more widely. NDAs will be\nrequired from anyone working on the project.\nI‚Äôll be able to provide: Hiring data for our new grad program (we\nhave a new selection pipeline that is AI-automated up to the final\ninterviews), and Data about promotion and salary for our entire staff.\nLet me know if you have any questions, and if you‚Äôre ready to get the\nball rolling, please complete this NDA (docx or pdf) and submit them\nthrough our NDA portal. After that, I‚Äôll reach out with the data. Would\nbe great if the final deliverable could have a summary targeted for the\nBoard of Directors, as well as a more technical piece for our data team\nto look over as well.\nI assume same fee structure as last time applies? That will be fine\non our end. Will pay hourly with a cap at 40 hours unless otherwise\ndiscussed.\nBest,\nGideon Blake\nChief People Officer | Black Saber Software\nEmail 2\n(text for screen readers/easier reading follows)\n\nEmail from Gideon:\nHi again, great to know that you‚Äôre on board for this project.\nThe data team set something up for you to get the data. I‚Äôve\nforwarded the details they sent, see below, all the descriptions of the\ndata are there.\nAccording to the legal team, it was better to only give you data for\nour current employees, so those are the only people in that data.\nGenerally, we have a pretty good retention rate, though.\nOne of my People and Talent guys mentioned that we don‚Äôt collect data\non ethnicity/race but that the team is considering it for EDI\ninitiatives after a conference they went to, and he said it might also\nbe related to salary. Once again, I don‚Äôt think anything like that will\nbe an issue for us.\nThe board wants to hear that our hiring, promotion and salary\nprocesses are all fair, and based on talent and value to the company.\nThey‚Äôre especially interested in the hiring pipeline as we‚Äôve been\ntrialling an AI service that screens applications and then invites\ncandidates to submit a pre-recorded video that the system rates for\nrelevant features. Candidates are also invited to do a timed technical\ncoding task and submit a writing sample and these are also assessed by\nthe system. More on that in the docs, too.\nLet me know if you have any questions, looking forward to the report\non April 21.\nBest,\nGideon Blake\nChief People Officer | Black Saber Software¬†\nForwarded email:\nHi G,\nThe team has prepped the documentation you asked for, the consultants\ncan access the data by running\n`devtools::install_github(‚Äústa303-bolton/sta303project‚Äù)`.

You do not need to include the original\ndata.\nOne team member will submit on behalf of the group but all\nmembers should be able to see the submission status.\n\nLate submission policy\nFor assessments in Type 1, late assessments will\nstill be accepted through Crowdmark, but only if they are your\nfirst submission. You will lose 10 percentage points on the\nassessment, per day, with submissions accepted for up to 3 days after\nthe due date. I.e., 72 hours after the initial due date.\nGrace period: Projects submitted before 8:00 p.m. ET\non April 21 will have no late penalty applied.\nAccommodations and extension policy\nPlease note that as this assessment is due near the very end of\nthe assessment period, there is limited flexibility for accommodations\nand extensions. While I would love to be able to otherwise, a busy final\nassessment period will not be sufficient reason to\ngrant an extension.¬†\nIf you miss a type 1 assessment due to illness or a serious personal\nemergency, please complete¬†this\nformwithin ONE week of the due date of the assignment. Upon\nreceipt of your form, we will contact you via email within 3 business\ndays to arrange an accommodation.
