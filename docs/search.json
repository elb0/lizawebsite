I know this can be hard or intimidating in large classes, but it can be really important. Introduce yourself, come to office hours, if there are opportunities to talk about what your interests are, take them. While you don‚Äôt want to be giving your networking elevator pitch every week in office hour, taking a bit of that networking attitude into your interactions isn‚Äôt a bad thing. I‚Äôm interested in what you‚Äôre doing and what you‚Äôre passionate about! Additionally, many reference questionnaires ask us to talk about your speaking skills. An instructor you‚Äôve never spoken to, especially in a large class, is unlikely to be able to meet with you just to see if you communicate well before deciding whether or not to write for you‚Äîthey should already have an idea of this when your request lands in their inbox!\nRohan Alexander, in a post about grad school applications, says ‚ÄúThe best letters are from folks that know you and your work. You need to spend a huge amount of effort getting decent letters. They‚Äôre as important, if not more, as your GPA.‚Äù I‚Äôd definitely recommend you check out the rest of his advice on how to think about reference letters.\nGit/GitHub skills\nSee ‚ÄòHappy Git with R‚Äô below for more information.\nTeamwork tips (from Google)\nBeing able to work in a team is often listed as a key skill in job ads and is an important part of many data competitions and courses your may undertake. Effective team work isn‚Äôt a given and really is a skill you can develop. And guess what? Google has spent years researching effective teamwork! They took a data-driven approach to understand how to form effective teams. ‚ÄúThe researchers found that what really mattered was less about who is on the team, and more about how the team worked together.‚Äù\nHere were some of the most important findings:\nü§∑Ô∏è Personality mix doesn‚Äôt matter\nüß† Psychological safety matters the most and you can foster it with:\nüó£Ô∏è‚ÄúEquality in conversational turn-talking‚Äù, i.e.¬†taking turns and talking an equal amount\nüëÇListening (what are your strategies for showing you‚Äôre really listening when working online? ü§î)\nI‚Äôd highly recommend taking a look at the re:work guide, it has some things you can discuss as a group and links to lots of other resources.\nOther related links:\nüì∫ Amy Edmondson‚Äôs TED Talk on psychological safety\nüì∫ The re:work YouTube channel‚Äîconsider starting with Teams, psychological safety, and Saturday Night Live by Charles Duhigg.\nüì∫ A 4 minute summary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHIikHJV9fI\nRecommended reading\nR for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham\nhttps://r4ds.had.co.nz\nIf you‚Äôve been my student I‚Äôve probably already told you about this amazing free textbook by New Zealander and rock star of the R world, Hadley Wickham (@hadleywickham).\nChapter 3 covers basics of ggplot (using the same data as Danielle Navarro does in her videos) üöó\nChapter 5 covers the basics of dplyr, a package that has saved me many hours of work when data wrangling\nüìñAnecdote time: I always recommend this book because back in NZ when one of my friends wanted to pivot from working as an organic chemist and get in to statistical consulting he worked through this book and in the space of only 2‚Äì3 months was taking on large chunks of client work for my consulting business. A fabulous crash course in being useful in R.\nHappy Git with R by Jenny Bryan, the STAT 545 TAs and Jim Hester\nhttps://happygitwithr.com/\nWhat is Git and why do you want it?\nIf you haven‚Äôt already, get yourself setup with GitHub as a key component of your portfolio building. It will supercharge your version control and your ability to collaborate with others and provides a great way to host a website on which to share your portfolio.\nI think Jenny Bryan has a great introduction in her Happy Git with R, so I‚Äôll let her explain the rest:\n\n‚ÄúGit is a version control system. Its original purpose was to help groups of developers work collaboratively on big software projects. Git manages the evolution of a set of files ‚Äì called a repository ‚Äì in a sane, highly structured way. If you have no idea what I‚Äôm talking about, think of it as the‚ÄùTrack Changes\" features from Microsoft Word on steroids.\nGit has been re-purposed by the data science community. In addition to using it for source code, we use it to manage the motley collection of files that make up typical data analytical projects, which often consist of data, figures, reports, and, yes, source code.\nA solo data analyst, working on a single computer, will benefit from adopting version control. But not nearly enough to justify the pain of installation and workflow upheaval. There are much easier ways to get versioned back ups of your files, if that‚Äôs all you‚Äôre worried about.\nIn my opinion, for new users, the pros of Git only outweigh the cons when you factor in the overhead of communicating and collaborating with other people. Who among us does not need to do that? Your life is much easier if this is baked into your workflow, as opposed to being a separate process that you dread or neglect.\"\n- Jenny Bryan, Happy Git with R, Section 1.1: Why Git? <https://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html>\n\nThere is also lots of great practical professional advice in here, too, like ‚ÄúPick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.‚Äù Save gamerangel420 for Reddit. (The first example I thought of I had to change‚Ä¶it actually was someone‚Äôs Reddit username.)\nTo do\nWork through Jenny Bryan‚Äôs awesome ‚ÄòHappy Git with R‚Äô\nSign up for the GitHub Education Student Developer Pack (access to hundreds of dollars worth of tools and training AND a GitHub pro account while you‚Äôre a student)\n\n\n\n",

This course allows high achieving statistics students to expand their knowledge in an area/to a level of depth that is usually outside what is offered in other undergraduate statistics courses.\nIt can be a great opportunity to test out if you like conducting research and it can help you think about whether you‚Äôre interested in graduate level studies. It is also a good way to get a high quality reference letter (assuming things go well) for graduate school.\nCalendar description\nIndependent study under the direction of a faculty member. Students wishing to take this course must have the permission of the Department of Statistical Sciences and of the prospective supervisor. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.\nPrerequisite\nAt least 1.0 FCE 300+ level STA courses with a minimum grade of 80% in each course.\nDoing a reading course with me\nFirst and foremost, here are some key things to know about my personal policies for reading courses:\nI only supervise the Fall to Winter (‚Äòyear‚Äô-long), half credit version of this course.\nI do not supervise reading courses over the Spring/Summer semesters.\nI can only supervise a small number of students in a given year.\nYou must come up with their own topic proposal in either applied statistics or statistics education to pitch to me.\nYou must have completed STA303 and/or some form of TA/RA or other engagement (like the ISSC) with me to be eligible. Basically, when I see your application, you want for me to recognize your name.\nMore information about applications coming soon.\nPrevious students\nThis section is still being developed.\nSamantha Pierre, 2020‚Äì21\nTitle: And the nominees are‚Ä¶An empirical study of the effects of a Tony Award Win and Nomination on a Show‚Äôs Success\nYou can hear Sam discuss the results of her project and her experience undertaking a reading course in her invited talk at the Toronto Data Workshop in May 2021.\n\n\nFollow Sam on Twitter, @WhamBamGAM.\nOther\nProf.¬†Rohan Alexander has written up two of the reading courses he‚Äôs offered and provided the details on his website.\nEthics and Data Science\nNatural Language Processing\n\n\n\n",

Be prepared for this and start thinking about it early. You should also always ask first, before you put someone‚Äôs name down. This is also true for job reference etiquette generally.\nMy policy is not to agree to write a reference for students if they have not completed a course with me.\nTo be able to write a reference that would actually strengthen your application, AND to have fair criteria considering that I get easily 100‚Äî150 requests per year and can usually only write for about 20‚Äì25 students (I know that sounds small‚Ä¶but it still takes a whole work week of time), my usual minimum criteria is at least two out of the following activities with me:\nactive on Piazza/office hours + good mark in a standard class-based course (like STA303),\nstudent representative role,\nRA work,\nTA work\na reading course.\nSome examples from 2020/21 of students I said yes to:\nseveral students who had high marks in STA303 and were active and doing well in STA490 with me,\nstudents who had done STA303 and gone on to do great work as TAs or peer mentors for STA130 when I was teaching, and\na student who had done STA303 and was working on a reading course with me.\nWhat should you do if you think you fit my criteria?\nCOMING SOON\nFurther things to keep in mind:\nI need at least 3 week‚Äôs notice before your reference is due.\nI will write in support of 3 programs per student.\nComplete this form [not live yet]\nReferences for other things?\nThis will be on a bit more of a case-by-case basis.

Email me directly to discuss jobs/scholarships/internships etc. Please keep in mind, if all I can say about you is that ‚ÄúStudent X took my course and got grade Y‚Äù, I‚Äôm not going to be very useful to you.\nPlease also note that you should also always ask first, before you put someone‚Äôs name down.\n\n\n\n",

If you ever meet Liza, you will see that it is absolutely impossible to not get a massive positive energy recharge after talking to her. Liza is currently doing her PhD in Statistics, running a consultancy called The Data Embassy, speaking at events, teaching, mentoring. It would be my absolute pleasure to learn more about Liza and share her wonderful story.\n\nRead the full interview here\nDon‚Äôt cha wish your ggplot had colours like me?, R Ladies Auckland\n2019-06-12\nA lightning talk about using colour when plotting data with ggplot.\n\n\n\nfitvids('.shareagain', {players: 'iframe'});\n\n\n\n\n",
