Tidy Tuesday is a weekly social data project in R and a great way to start getting used to GitHub and building your portfolio with bitesize efforts.\nhttps://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday\nBenefits to in taking part (and in the spirit of going ‚Äúbeyond coursework‚Äù):\nexperience with tidying data\npractice generating interesting questions that you can approach with stats (harder than you think!)\npractice with data visualisation\nThere is a podcast, https://www.tidytuesday.com/and, a Slack group, r4ds.io, and even YouTube livestreams/videos.\nTo do\nCheck out previous week‚Äôs topics and work folks have done through #TidyTuesday on Twitter‚Äô.\nRead the list of community guidelines so you know what to do and how to behave.\nWhen the new dataset is posted on Monday, come chat about it in the #portfolio-building channel here on Slack. If you use Twitter, follow @thomas_mock and @R4DScommunity.\nResearch opportunities\nCheck out the Department of Statistical Sciences page on research opportunities, acholarships & awards\nMy page on reading courses.\nReference letters\nYou can read more about my requirements here.\nEvery instructor is different, but it is generally good advice to make sure they know who you are. I know this can be hard or intimidating in large classes, but it can be really important. Introduce yourself, come to office hours, if there are opportunities to talk about what your interests are, take them. While you don‚Äôt want to be giving your networking elevator pitch every week in office hour, taking a bit of that networking attitude into your interactions isn‚Äôt a bad thing. I‚Äôm interested in what you‚Äôre doing and what you‚Äôre passionate about! Additionally, many reference questionnaires ask us to talk about your speaking skills. An instructor you‚Äôve never spoken to, especially in a large class, is unlikely to be able to meet with you just to see if you communicate well before deciding whether or not to write for you‚Äîthey should already have an idea of this when your request lands in their inbox!\nRohan Alexander, in a post about grad school applications, says ‚ÄúThe best letters are from folks that know you and your work. You need to spend a huge amount of effort getting decent letters. They‚Äôre as important, if not more, as your GPA.‚Äù I‚Äôd definitely recommend you check out the rest of his advice on how to think about reference letters.\nOther useful resources\nThe U of T assignment calculator also has options to break writing a personal statement and graduate school applications more generally into steps, with lots of advice and helpful links!\nChapnick, A. (2009-03-09). How to ask for a reference letter. University Affairs.\nAlexander, R. (2021-03-12). Saturday morning thoughts on grad school applications.\nGit/GitHub skills\nSee ‚ÄòHappy Git with R‚Äô below for more information.\nBuilding a personal website\nOnce your Git & GitHub skills are sharp you‚Äôll be able to use GitHub pages to host a personal profile and portfolio for free. In summer 2021 there was a workshop series for the Independent Summer Statistics Community about this and you can access the resources here.\nIs this worth your time? I tend to think it is, as the effort of thinking about how you want to present yourself and what you value (personal brand), as well as what your brief elevator pitch/bio is, are useful and transferable to writing cover letters, personal statements and networking. Having a place where people can view your projects so that you can really demonstrate what you can do is also really valuable, and building the site with Distill for R and GitHub as a bit of a portfolio item in and of itself.\nTeamwork tips (from Google)\nBeing able to work in a team is often listed as a key skill in job ads and is an important part of many data competitions and courses your may undertake. Effective team work isn‚Äôt a given and really is a skill you can develop. And guess what? Google has spent years researching effective teamwork! They took a data-driven approach to understand how to form effective teams. ‚ÄúThe researchers found that what really mattered was less about who is on the team, and more about how the team worked together.‚Äù\nHere were some of the most important findings:\nü§∑Ô∏è Personality mix doesn‚Äôt matter\nüß† Psychological safety matters the most and you can foster it with:\nüó£Ô∏è‚ÄúEquality in conversational turn-talking‚Äù, i.e.¬†taking turns and talking an equal amount\nüëÇListening (what are your strategies for showing you‚Äôre really listening when working online? ü§î)\nI‚Äôd highly recommend taking a look at the re:work guide, it has some things you can discuss as a group and links to lots of other resources.\nOther related links:\nüì∫ Amy Edmondson‚Äôs TED Talk on psychological safety\nüì∫ The re:work YouTube channel‚Äîconsider starting with Teams, psychological safety, and Saturday Night Live by Charles Duhigg.\nüì∫ A 4 minute summary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHIikHJV9fI\nPresentations\nPut slide numbers on your slides. If you can add the total number of slides (e.g.¬†2/10) even better. This makes it easier for people to record the slide number for asking a question later.\nR user? Learn to use Xaringan and host your slides online. Easy for people to follow along (increases accessibility!) and for you to promote your work. This is also possible with Google Slides and I imagine PowerPoint online, but Xaringan is especially great for code heavy presentations, whether you‚Äôre walking people through that code or using it to create your graphs and tables, without having to re-copy and paste and reformat any time there is a change.\nPublic speaking\nPlant your feet! My drama teacher used to warn against ‚Äòhappy feet‚Äô while speaking. It can be distracting for your audience and give a sense of nervous energy. It is okay to be nervous‚ÄîI kinda love public speaking but still get nervous each and every time‚Äîbut your message is often better received if people aren‚Äôt distracted thinking ‚Äúoh poor thing, they are so nervous right now!‚Äù\nRecommended reading\nR for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham\nhttps://r4ds.had.co.nz\nIf you‚Äôve been my student I‚Äôve probably already told you about this amazing free textbook by New Zealander and rock star of the R world, Hadley Wickham (@hadleywickham).\nChapter 3 covers basics of ggplot (using the same data as Danielle Navarro does in her videos) üöó\nChapter 5 covers the basics of dplyr, a package that has saved me many hours of work when data wrangling\nüìñAnecdote time: I always recommend this book because back in NZ when one of my friends wanted to pivot from working as an organic chemist and get in to statistical consulting he worked through this book and in the space of only 2‚Äì3 months was taking on large chunks of client work for my consulting business. A fabulous crash course in being useful in R.\nHappy Git with R by Jenny Bryan, the STAT 545 TAs and Jim Hester\nhttps://happygitwithr.com/\nWhat is Git and why do you want it?\nIf you haven‚Äôt already, get yourself setup with GitHub as a key component of your portfolio building. It will supercharge your version control and your ability to collaborate with others and provides a great way to host a website on which to share your portfolio.\nI think Jenny Bryan has a great introduction in her Happy Git with R, so I‚Äôll let her explain the rest:\n\n‚ÄúGit is a version control system. Its original purpose was to help groups of developers work collaboratively on big software projects. Git manages the evolution of a set of files ‚Äì called a repository ‚Äì in a sane, highly structured way. If you have no idea what I‚Äôm talking about, think of it as the‚ÄùTrack Changes‚Äù features from Microsoft Word on steroids.\nGit has been re-purposed by the data science community. In addition to using it for source code, we use it to manage the motley collection of files that make up typical data analytical projects, which often consist of data, figures, reports, and, yes, source code.\nA solo data analyst, working on a single computer, will benefit from adopting version control. But not nearly enough to justify the pain of installation and workflow upheaval. There are much easier ways to get versioned back ups of your files, if that‚Äôs all you‚Äôre worried about.\nIn my opinion, for new users, the pros of Git only outweigh the cons when you factor in the overhead of communicating and collaborating with other people. Who among us does not need to do that? Your life is much easier if this is baked into your workflow, as opposed to being a separate process that you dread or neglect.‚Äù\n- Jenny Bryan, Happy Git with R, Section 1.1: Why Git? <https://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html>\n\nThere is also lots of great practical professional advice in here, too, like ‚ÄúPick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.‚Äù Save gamerangel420 for Reddit. (The first example I thought of I had to change‚Ä¶it actually was someone‚Äôs Reddit username.)\nTo do\nWork through Jenny Bryan‚Äôs awesome ‚ÄòHappy Git with R‚Äô\nSign up for the GitHub Education Student Developer Pack (access to hundreds of dollars worth of tools and training AND a GitHub pro account while you‚Äôre a student)\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nI get a lot of emails. A lot of similar emails. So, I have an email auto-response on all-year round.\nBelow is a lightly reformatted version of my current message, just in case you find it easier to access here.\nPlease note: This is for my U of T email address. Queries to my personal email or other emails do not received this.\nLast updated 2023-04-10\nHi there,\nThis autoresponder has some personal news and some answers to Frequently Asked Questions. You can also read a version of this message online here.\nPersonal news: My time with U of T is coming to an end this summer, June 2023. I‚Äôll miss the wonderful DoSS community greatly, but my partner and I have decided to move to be closer to family. I will still be available until the end of June, but not taking on new initiatives as I wrap things up. üá®üá¶‚û°Ô∏èüá≥üáø\nFinal grades: I will not adjust an individual‚Äôs final grade unless I have made a mistake in your calculation. Request to change a grade because you want a higher one, or because you‚Äôre close to a certain GPA threshold or program requirement cannot be considered.\nGraduate school references: Please read my personal policy here to get a sense of under what circumstances I could write for you, but basically, a good mark in one class is not sufficient and you need to have at least two ‚Äòactivities‚Äô with me. If you believe you meet my basic criteria, you can request a reference from me here. I will then accept or decline based on the information provided.\nNote: This platform will be changing as I leave U of T. Bookmark my policy page, I will update instructions there when they are available.\n\nResearch/work study/teaching assistant opportunities:\nSee the Department website. The main round of TA recruitment occurs during the summer but there are occasionally emergency postings.\nLooking for a project to build up your portfolio?\nTry a previous STA303 final project. Previous students have successfully used these projects in applications and interviews for internships/jobs.\n2021: Consulting for fake company Black Saber Software, analyzing their hiring and employee data and creating a report appropriate for the Board of Directors on the topic of gender parity in hiring, wages and promotion. See here for client emails, other info, and how to get the data (see bottom of page).\n2022: Consulting for fake company MINGAR, analyzing customer data for their Canadian fitness tracker/watch market and investigating a concern about poorer product performance for users with darker skin. This project also includes some modern data skills, like accessing an API to retrieve a large volume of data, scraping a table from a website into a usable dataset and using a licensed postal code conversion file for data linkage. See the client email and general info (Step 5 might be most helpful), and access the data and template on JupyterHub (U of T only) or GitHub.\nI also always recommend TidyTuesday datasets and you may find Chapter 4 of Building a Career in Data Science interesting (the authors have made it available for free on that website).\n\n\n\nMasters/PhDs: I am not taking on Masters or PhD students. Please see the graduate section of our Department website for more information: https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/graduate.\nProspective PhD students, all applications are made through a central portal, you don‚Äôt (to my knowledge) need a sponsoring faculty member, but can check out the team here. You will be able to select up to three potential supervisors at the time of your application (but again note that I‚Äôm not taking on students).\n\nIf your email is answered by one of the topics covered above, please consider this automatic reply my response. Please note that this is especially the case for references and graduate study inquiries.\nIf your question isn‚Äôt answered here, I will respond when I can. Please allow at least 48 hours, Monday‚ÄìFriday, for a response before following up.\nBest,\nLiza\nDoing okay?

We have some exciting funding and an amazing team.\nEquity, diversity and inclusion\nAs a white, settler Canadian statistician, I have a lot of learning to do about Indigenous Data Sovereignty and and decolonizing methodologies and higher education. I want Statistics to become a more equitable, diverse and inclusive discipline and seek to work with like-minded individuals to learn and take meaningful action.\nMember of the Faculty of Arts and Science Indigenous Teaching, Learning and Research Committee 2020‚Äì\nMember of the Department of Statistical Sciences EDI Committee 2021‚Äì\nDepartment liaison and instructor for the Pursue Stem program 2021‚Äì\nRead an article about Pursue STEM, featuring DoSS PhD candidate Nnenna Asidianya.\n\nInstitutional Strategic Initiatives Data Science Institute writing group for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, member, March 2021\nBuilding community among Undergraduate Statistics students: The Independent Summer Statistics Community\nFor the second summer of COVID-19, the Department of Statistical Sciences (DoSS) created a community for students in our programs of study. About 300 students signed up this summer and we had a student lead Python learning community, several awesome guest speakers, student-led workshops and we held a case competition about ‚ÄòLivable Toronto‚Äô as a chance for students to think about moving back to the city, as well as build up their portfolios and get relevant experience with data analysis, communication and teamwork. The faculty team involved is so proud of the students! We‚Äôre currently thinking about what this kind of community building looks like going forwards.\nSupporting student mental health\nI hope that the challenges of the last 16 months accelerated our progress in lasting ways when it comes to having a shared vocabulary and approaches to supporting mental health in our community. In some ways, having everything be so topsy-turvy felt like it created greater permission to bring mental health resources into the classroom in bigger ways where I think I would have been fearful of ‚Äòew this is feelings not stats‚Äô pushback from some quarters in the past.\nOther things I‚Äôve introduced over the course of the last year that I‚Äôm going to keep include making time to include wellness resources in my modules, and trying to speak to strategies I‚Äôve found helpful in my own learning journey.\nIn STA303 we created a ‚Äòreading week lite‚Äô to break up the long stretch between the real reading week and the end of semester. During this week students had a lot of choice in how they interacted with the course. They could take an almost complete break, with no new content or required quizzes, if that‚Äôs what they needed, and/or work on some revision and/or get bonus points for attending or watching the recording of two events, one on 5 Ways to Wellbeing and one Academic Resilience. This was the only time I have ever hit the 300 person Zoom cap! It was so rewarding to see that, when you put your money (or your class time and your bonus points) where your mouth is as a prof, students will really sincerely and positively engage. We‚Äôre currently looking at how to adapt this kind of programming and pacing to future courses when we‚Äôre not in the middle of a pandemic and I‚Äôve also invited mental health resource people into my STA490 class and taken up opportunities to get further training myself.\nEmpathy and well-being panel, invited speaker Center for Teaching Support & Innovation, University of Toronto (2021-02-24)\nDeveloped and delivered Initiate and Facilitate: Strategies and technology for supporting mental health and well-being in large online classes workshop with partners from FAS Mental Health Team and CTSI\nIdentify-Assist-Refer COVID training delivered by Faculty of Arts and Science Mental Health team (2020-06-12)\nLivingWorks training (2021-06-22), learning the TASC steps to recognize thoughts of suicide and engage safety resources\nStudent voice\nIn DoSS, we‚Äôre going to be continuing a pilot of a student voice initiative: the Undergraduate Consultative Committee. Interested students from participating classes could put themselves forward for a lottery to become a rep for their section. The consultative committee, which included the students the instructors and also department staff, met twice a semester with contact directly between instructors and the reps in between. This really helped the participating instructors make useful tweaks to their courses while they were in progress, instead of waiting to to have ‚Äúoh, duh!‚Äù moments when reading course evaluations after it was too late. It creates opportunities for student reps to gain leadership experience as well.\nTrauma-informed pedagogy, pedagogy for reopening\nSomething I‚Äôm in the early stages of is learning more about is trauma-informed pedagogy. I‚Äôm working with a cross-disciplinary group of faculty to build our skills and share this approach more broadly at U of T. It links to a lot of the above ideas about flexibility, student voice, community, mental health, as well as universal design principles for accessibility and I think is going to be a very important lens for us to be able to recover from the pandemic together and to improve teaching practice more generally, for the long term. Some additional key ideas include safety, trust & transparency, and awareness of cultural/historical/gender issues.\nOther things I should write more about\nHelping students become better statistical communicators, Writing Integrated Teaching Liaison\nInnovative assessments\n‚ÄòMixed assessment‚Äô timed/untimed to make large course tests more ‚Äòreal-world‚Äô\n‚ÄòExplain like I‚Äôm a‚Ä¶‚Äô presentations, communicating concepts at a range of levels\n\nExperiential learning (STA130 and STA490 collaborative projects, ASA DataFest@UofT)\nArts & Science Computational and Data Science Education Working Group, member 2020¬¨2021\nArts & Science Digital Learning Strategy Steering Committee, member, January‚ÄìMay 2021\nCensus @ School Committee member, Statistical Society of Canada (2020¬¨present)\nDepartment of Statistics Undergraduate Committee, member, ongoing\nApplied Research and Education Seminar Series (CANSSI Ontario and DoSS), committee member 2020‚Äì2021\n\n\n\n",

This course allows high achieving statistics students to expand their knowledge in an area/to a level of depth that is usually outside what is offered in other undergraduate statistics courses.\nIt can be a great opportunity to test out if you like conducting research and it can help you think about whether you‚Äôre interested in graduate level studies. It is also a good way to get a high quality reference letter (assuming things go well) for graduate school.\nCalendar description\nIndependent study under the direction of a faculty member. Students wishing to take this course must have the permission of the Department of Statistical Sciences and of the prospective supervisor. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.\nPrerequisites\nAt least 1.0 FCE 300+ level STA courses with a minimum grade of 80% in each course.\nDoing a reading course with me\nFirst and foremost, here are some key things to know about my personal policies for reading courses:\nI only supervise the Fall to Winter (‚Äòyear‚Äô-long), half credit version of this course.\nI do not supervise reading courses over the Spring/Summer semesters.\nI can only supervise a small number of students in a given year.\nYou must come up with a topic proposal in either applied statistics or statistics education to pitch to me. We will develop it together, but I want you to be interested in the topic and feel ownership of the project.\nYou must have completed STA303 and/or some form of TA/RA or other engagement (like the ISSC) with me to be eligible. Basically, when I see your application, you want for me to recognize your name.\nTopics and projects on which I‚Äôm interested in working with students\nThere are two styles of reading course you could consider:\n1. Project-based\nYou propose a topic for which data is available that you wish to apply statistical methods to and produce a report. This style of project may be useful if you‚Äôre considering a thesis-based Master‚Äôs in an applied statistics area as it lets you dip your toe in and see if you like it.\nI tend to be most interested in topics on social and economic issues, but part of the reason I am a Statistician is because I love learning new things. Convince me your topic is interesting and/or relevant to making the world a better place and if I have the right skills to support you, I‚Äôll be interested.\nI do not use a lot of Bayesian, machine learning or time series methods in my own work, and personally use R. Topics using these methods or other programming languages aren‚Äôt necessarily ruled out, but you‚Äôll need to demonstrate a plan for reasonable pre-/co-requisite courses and previous experience.\nI am also open to co-supervising with faculty from other disciplines for cross-disciplinary work.\n2. Literature and task-based\nYou choose a topic, related to one of my interest areas below, and together we create a reading and task list for your to work through across the year. You might write a literature review, prepare a workshop or talk, write blog posts, etc. This is more similar to a traditional course experience than option 1, but is an opportunity to explore a topic not covered in other statistics course, build professional skills relevant to research/future employment.\nTopics areas of interest\nethical professional practice for statisticians\nindigenous data sovereignty\nethics of web scraping\ngraphicacy and how not to lie with charts\nsampler platter of ethics topics, e.g.¬†algorithmic bias, disclosure risk, privacy/confidenitality, accessibility, reproducibility, professional codes of conduct\n\nstatistics education\nassessment practices for ethical professional practice\nteaching and learning simulation-based inference\ntrauma-informed pedagogy for statistics classrooms\nonline learning (potential data from STA130)\n\nI may consider some other topics, but the above are best aligned with my current research.\nHow register your interest\n\n\n\nSee the information on the Special Enrolment Sharepoint Page for the Department.

How to ask about references for a few years from now.\nGeneral tips and advice\nReferences for other things?\n\nGrad school references\nIf you‚Äôre aiming for grad school, you‚Äôll most likely need a few lecturers to agree to write letters/fill out forms in support of your application. Be prepared for this and start thinking about it early. You should also always ask first, before you put someone‚Äôs name down. This is also true for job reference etiquette generally.\nMy policy is not to agree to write a reference for students if they have not yet completed a course with me.\nTo be able to write a reference that would actually strengthen your application, my usual minimum criteria is at least two out of the following activities with me:\nactive on Piazza (or Ed Discussion)/office hours AND good mark in a standard class-based course [PLEASE NOTE, all of this counts as ONE activity and one course is not enough by itself unless I have told you otherwise],\nstudent representative role,\nRA work,\nTA work\na reading course (UofT).\nSome examples of students I have said yes to (University of Toronto):\nseveral students who had high marks in STA303 and were active and doing well in STA490 with me,\nstudents who had done STA303 and gone on to do great work as TAs or peer mentors for STA130 when I was teaching, and\na student who had done STA303 and was working on a reading course with me.\nFurther things to keep in mind:\nI need at least 3‚Äì5 week‚Äôs notice before your reference is due.\nI will write in support of 3 programs per student.\nI will only agree if I can write you a strong letter. Anything less is a waste of your and my time. Example of things I am frequently asked to rate about students that a good grade alone won‚Äôt tell me:\nClarity of Goals for Graduate Study\nOral Expression in English\nAbility to Work Independently\nAbility to Work with Others\nResearch Potential\nMotivation\n‚ÄúHumility‚Äù and ‚Äúsense of humour‚Äù are other examples that I personally hate, but your chosen program(s) might ask.\n\nIf offered (i.e., if there is a tick box), please waive your right to access the report. (You can ask me directly if I am comfortable sharing it with you.) This is usually just for American schools, you can read more here.\nDON‚ÄôT offer to write a draft for me (I don‚Äôt accept this, and schools may ask you to declare something like ‚ÄúI confirm that I will not write any portion of this evaluation, nor will I have any involvement in its drafting or submission.‚Äù anyways), DO provide lots of specific details, examples and relevant files when completing the request form or subsequent details form (there is a second form if I approve you first request). Tell me enough that I could approve/write this even if I got partial amnesia.\nWhat should you do if you think you fit my criteria?\nIf you meet the criteria above, please send me an email to discuss my support. In this email, it would be great to include as many of the following as you can:\nA brief summary of your goals for grad school\nWhat do you want to study, where and why? This could be a draft of your personal statement or some bullet points, etc.\n\nYour transcript (unofficial is fine)\nA list of the course(s) you did with me, with the semester & year\nInformation about the general timeline\nWhen are things due? How many applications? Please note my usual limit of 3 programmes.\n\nNotes on and/or files for assessments from my classes (if relevant)\nResearch assistant or summer scholarship work/reports you‚Äôve done with me (if relevant)\nDissertation or final report if I supervised you for a Data Science Masters project (UoA) or reading course (UofT)\nSummary of any teaching assistant roles you‚Äôve had with me or related to a course I teach on (if relevant)\nIndustry then grad school? How to ask about references for a few years from now.\nSeveral students have very sensibly asked what they should do if they plan to work for a year or two before grad school. A great question and my attempt to provide some clarity below.\nSo firstly, the ‚Äòtwo activity criterion‚Äô (from above) still applies, but you don‚Äôt need to fill out the form now.\nWhat you should do now:\nIFF (if and only if) you meet my criteria, let me know that this is what you‚Äôre considering. Do it via email so a few years from now when you ask and I search your name, I‚Äôll have a record of the conversation.\nCreate a folder/document with notes about the things I might know about you.\nSave copies of any assignments you‚Äôre particularly proud of (like a STA130/STA303/STA490 final project (UofT)) and make note of whether you did it as a group, what the grade you got was etc. Don‚Äôt assume future you will remember this. Future me definitely won‚Äôt!\n\nWhat you should do when you‚Äôre planning to apply:\nMake sure you plan ahead and get a sense of the deadlines from programs you are interested in. Aim to get back in touch with me (see next point) 5‚Äì6 weeks before your first due date.\nCheck back on this page to see what my request instructions are (i.e., there is currently a request form linked above) and follow any instructions provided. This is where your notes will come in handy!

This page doesn‚Äôt have information about specific student projects, but should give you a sense of the kinds of skills students who completed this project will have. You may wish to skip directly to the skills description.\nOne sentence description: Students merged, wrangled, visualized, summarized and modelled data on hiring, salary and promotion to meet a client brief, and reported on their methods and findings appropriately for a general executive audience and, separately, for a technical audience.\nBut first, some context\nSTA303: Methods of Data Analysis II is a course delivered by the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto.\nIn Winter 2021 (January to April), STA303 was run completely online due to COVID-19. Students rose to this challenge remarkably well, but it was a significant challenge to wellbeing and focus, none-the-less.\nSTA303 is a communication- and application-focused course where students learn:\nto merge, wrangle, summarize and visualize data,\nabout several statistical modelling approaches and how to choose and implement these, as well as\nhow to write about their methods and results for a range of audiences.\nThe models covered include: linear mixed models, generalized linear models, generalized linear mixed models and generalized additive models.\nProject task summary\nI‚Äôve included full information on this assessment at the end of this page, but it is not needed to understand it. The project was worth 30% of students‚Äô final grades and students could choose to complete it individually or as a team. Teamwork was recommended, but the task was the same either way. Teams were not required as students had good reasons for completing individually, such as being located in a challenging time zone, lack of access to internet appropriate for calling, or other caring or work obligations that made scheduling meetings untenable.\nStudents were consulting for Black Saber Software, analyzing their hiring and employee data and tasked with creating a report appropriate for the Board of Directors on the topic of gender parity in hiring, wages and promotion. Note: Black Saber isn‚Äôt a real company, it would be massively reckless to provide 600 people with employee data with this level of detail. It would be very easy to identify individuals from data like this. That said, this dataset was simulated based on real research and employment trends and draws on my own consulting experiences.\nEach team or individual created a consulting company for the purposes of this activity and to register their group/individual status completed a pseudo-NDA, of which the only real part was reminding them that they had already agreed to several codes of conduct as part of their enrolment at U of T and made clear my expectations of their professionalism. It also gave them a chance to familiarize themselves with a common requirement for consulting.\nThe deliverable\nThe final submission was a report that included:\na cover page\nan executive summary (2 pages max)\na technical report\nconsultant bio(s) (note: these bios were meant to be ‚Äòfun‚Äô illustrations of their aspirations and interests and are not necessarily accurate), and\na company ethics statement.\nStudents were tasked to answer the research questions posed by the client, communicate their findings in ways appropriate to the audience for each section of the report, choose appropriate methods and create professional visualizations and tables to explain their results.\nReports were written in a reproducible R Markdown file (a code and text file type popular for use with the programming language R). Students were provided with a basic template that they could choose to use.\nSkills demonstrated\nStudents who completed this project to a reasonable standard can do the following (organized under broad headings):\nStatistical reasoning and knowledge\nDevelop relevant research questions that can be explored/answered statistically.\nMerge large datasets programmatically and wrangle them appropriately to create meaningful new variables, where relevant.\nChoose and create appropriate data visualizations and summaries.\nChoose appropriate statistical models and check their assumptions.\nJustify their choice of methods in writing.\nAccurately describe results, including size and direction of effect through confidence intervals, where relevant.\nIdentify and discuss strengths and limitations of their statistical approaches.\nEthical professional practice\nUnderstand and put into their own words aspects of the Statistical Society of Canada Code of Ethical Statistical Practice. (Demonstrated through the code of conduct they wrote for their ‚Äòcompany‚Äô.)\nReport findings truthfully and accurately, even when they are not what a stakeholder ‚Äòwants to hear‚Äô.\nIdentify potential sources of algorithmic bias.\nWriting\nWrite appropriately for different audiences, i.e.¬†an executive summary for executives with limited statistical knowledge and a technical report for fellow analysts (though not necessarily ones familiar with R).\nFormat a report with a logical structure.\nWork within length constraints to prioritize expressing the key information from a series of analyses.\nProgramming\nCreate reproducible code and suppress code appropriately in a final ‚Äòhuman-readable‚Äô report. I.e., no error outputs in the final PDF or raw variable names used.\nUse data wrangling and visualization functions and packages (largely dplyr and ggplot2, if that means anything to you).\nComment on and organize their code logically.\nGeneral\nConstruct and label tables and figures professionally.\nBe resilient in the face of challenges, especially when it comes to troubleshooting code bugs.\nAsk for help when they need it while also taking responsibility for their work.\nFull assessment instructions and rubric\nNote: If you‚Äôre a fellow instructor and interested in using any of this, reach out! I am happy to share originals, etc.\n‚ÄúClient‚Äù emails\nEmail 1 (text for screen readers/easier reading follows)\n\nHi,\nThanks again for the great work on the Pax Aurora project last year. I‚Äôm reaching out with another piece of work I‚Äôm hoping you can take on.\nInternally, people have been raising concerns about potential bias in our hiring and remuneration processes. I don‚Äôt think there is much to it, but I want to be able to report to the Board that we‚Äôve had external statisticians take a look and that everything is totally above board. That said, several companies in our area have had bad press about this recently, nasty complaints from staff to reporters, etc. and I want to ensure we‚Äôre out ahead of any potential issues. Obviously, I value your discretion and don‚Äôt want this mentioned more widely. NDAs will be required from anyone working on the project.\nI‚Äôll be able to provide: Hiring data for our new grad program (we have a new selection pipeline that is AI-automated up to the final interviews), and Data about promotion and salary for our entire staff. Let me know if you have any questions, and if you‚Äôre ready to get the ball rolling, please complete this NDA (docx or pdf) and submit them through our NDA portal. After that, I‚Äôll reach out with the data. Would be great if the final deliverable could have a summary targeted for the Board of Directors, as well as a more technical piece for our data team to look over as well.\nI assume same fee structure as last time applies? That will be fine on our end. Will pay hourly with a cap at 40 hours unless otherwise discussed.\nBest,\nGideon Blake\nChief People Officer | Black Saber Software\nEmail 2 (text for screen readers/easier reading follows)\n\nEmail from Gideon:\nHi again, great to know that you‚Äôre on board for this project.\nThe data team set something up for you to get the data. I‚Äôve forwarded the details they sent, see below, all the descriptions of the data are there.\nAccording to the legal team, it was better to only give you data for our current employees, so those are the only people in that data. Generally, we have a pretty good retention rate, though.\nOne of my People and Talent guys mentioned that we don‚Äôt collect data on ethnicity/race but that the team is considering it for EDI initiatives after a conference they went to, and he said it might also be related to salary. Once again, I don‚Äôt think anything like that will be an issue for us.\nThe board wants to hear that our hiring, promotion and salary processes are all fair, and based on talent and value to the company. They‚Äôre especially interested in the hiring pipeline as we‚Äôve been trialling an AI service that screens applications and then invites candidates to submit a pre-recorded video that the system rates for relevant features. Candidates are also invited to do a timed technical coding task and submit a writing sample and these are also assessed by the system. More on that in the docs, too.\nLet me know if you have any questions, looking forward to the report on April 21.\nBest,\nGideon Blake\nChief People Officer | Black Saber Software¬†\nForwarded email:\nHi G,\nThe team has prepped the documentation you asked for, the consultants can access the data by running `devtools::install_github(‚Äústa303-bolton/sta303project‚Äù)`.

Short quizzes can engage students in checking their understanding throughout a course and support their preparation for higher-stakes assessments. While auto-marking can help reduce teaching team workload, the creation and maintenance of high-quality and fair question banks can be very demanding. To support this, a range of computational tools exist for creating auto-marked questions and deploying them to assessment platforms (e.g., the R package exams, Gr√ºn & Zeileis, 2009). However, while there is guidance for the practical implementation of these tools (e.g., Zeileis et al., 2014), there is very little documentation that explains the design process for developing models that can generate tens or even hundreds of versions of questions. This talk has three aims:\n1) to explore design principles that support pedagogy-first approaches to creating question-generating models,\n2) to share considerations and opportunities with respect to having students analyse data (with iNZight Lite) to answer quiz questions, and\n3) to report on how students are actually using quizzes with multiple versions in a large introductory statistics course, including findings based on data about quiz attempts, as well as reflections from the teaching team.\nSlides\nDirect link: https://lizabolton.github.io/2024-12-02_NZSA-Wellington/#/title-slide\n\n\n\n\n\nThis way or data-way: A survival guide for a world of data, Raising the Bar Auckland\n2024-08-27\nBlurb: What do motivational posts on LinkedIn have in common with the supposedly small feet of Victorians?

There are multiple course codes as this is an important service course for Science, Arts and Business students.\nSTATS 330 (Semester 2)\nR is the programming language used. Familiarity from STATS 201/208 is expected.\nI use and teach a lot of tidyverse, especially dplyr for data wrangling and ggplot for visualization.\nIf you‚Äôre not familiar with these, consider checking out:\nchapters 3 and 5 of R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham & Garret Grolemund, and\nthe DoSS Toolkit, especially the modules ‚ÄòHand me my plyrs‚Äô and To ggplot or not to ggplot.\n\n\nSTATS 330 further develops ideas introduced in STATS 201/208, giving a synthesis and broader understanding of generalised linear models and related methods. Simulation-based procedures, including bootstrapping and cross-validation, are introduced as a means to provide robust inference, investigate the consequences of assumption violations, and solve goodness-of-fit and model-selection problems. Particular focus is placed on how the modelling procedure varies depending on whether the analysis aims to explain an underlying process or predict future observations. Students will learn to implement all methods taught in R, the widely used, open-source software environment for statistical computing. Emphasis is on practical application, providing students with a versatile statistical toolbox useful for a range of fields in both academia and industry, including almost all subjects in Business and Economics, along with any experimental or social science. It is also a useful complement to Computer Science.\n~ Course description from the course outline\n2023\nSTATS 101/108 (1st half of S2)\nThis course has recently undergone a significant rewrite by the STATS 10x team including Anna Fergusson, Thomas Lumley, Emma Lehrke, Lars Thomsen and others. It has a focus on interactive lectures and modern data considerations.\nI was of the teaching team in second semester.\nMore information on the course is available in the Course outline. There are multiple course codes as this is an important service course for Science, Arts and Business students.\nSTATS 369 (1st half of S2)\nThis course has been developed by Thomas Lumley (Department of Statistics), with additional teaching and development by Lisa Chen (Statistics), David Welch (Computer Science), Yalu Wen (Statistics).\nThis is a course on predictive modelling using real data. STATS 369 is required for the major in Data Science but is also taken by undergraduate students from other majors in Science, Engineering, and Commerce who are interested in careers involving large-scale data analysis and modelling. This course is good preparation for anyone wanting to do postgraduate study in Data Science. We emphasise understanding the modelling techniques in addition to being able to apply them using R. The predictive techniques covered include linear regression and discrimination, tree-based models, and neural networks. The course also covers the data cleaning and manipulation needed to prepare real-world data for analysis and some of the ethical issues that arise from the use of automated predictive models. The skills developed in this course are particularly useful for those wishing to have a career involving data science and predictive modelling, which are areas in high demand.\n~ Course description from the Course outline\nSTATS 150/150G (1st 5 classes of S2)\nThis course is coordinated by Stephanie Budgett. I taught the first 5 classes on media reports and surveys and polls.\nSTATS 150 aims to prepare anyone, regardless of whether or not they have any background in statistics, to become a critical consumer of statistical information. STATS 150 will be useful for aspiring journalists, politicians, political scientists, sociologists, lawyers, public communicators, health personnel, conservationists, environmental scientists, business people, marketers, engineers, and scientists. It examines the uses, limitations, and abuses of statistical information in a variety of activities such as polling, public health, sport, law, marketing, and the environment. The statistical concepts and thinking underlying data-based arguments will be explored. The interpretation and critical evaluation of statistically-based reports as well as the construction of statistically sound arguments and reports will be emphasised. Some course material will be drawn from topics currently in the news.\n~ Course description from the the Course outline\nSTATS 330 (2nd half of S1)\nCo-teaching one stream of 100 students with Prof.¬†Alain Vandal.\nCourse information.\nR is the programming language used in my courses.\nI tend to use and teach a lot of tidyverse, especially dplyr for data wrangling and ggplot for visualization.\nIf you‚Äôre not familiar with these, consider checking out:\nchapters 3 and 5 of R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham & Garret Grolemund, and\nthe DoSS Toolkit, especially the modules ‚ÄòHand me my plyrs‚Äô and To ggplot or not to ggplot.\n\n\n2017\nIn 2017 I was a Professional Teaching Fellow for 6 months, teaching STATS101/101/108: Introduction to Statistics.
