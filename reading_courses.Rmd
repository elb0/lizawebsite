## What are reading courses?

The [Department of Statistical Sciences](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/) offers [STA496: Readings in Statistics](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/current-students/special-enrolment-courses-sta490y1-sta492h1-sta496h1sta497h1#several-statistics-courses-have-special-enrolment-procedures-so-enrolment-in-these-courses-cannot-be-done-on-acorn-please-select-the-course-you-are-interested-in-from-the-list-below-for-information-on-the-enrolment-process-prerequisites-and-instructions-on-how-to-request-enrolment-accordion-3). This course allows high achieving statistics students to expand their knowledge in an area/to a level of depth that is usually outside what is offered in other undergraduate statistics courses. 

It can be a great opportunity to test out if you like conducting research and it can help you think about whether you're interested in graduate level studies. It is also a good way to get a high quality [reference letter](https://www.lizabolton.com/references.html) (assuming things go well) for graduate school.

### Calendar description
_Independent study under the direction of a faculty member. Students wishing to take this course must have the permission of the Department of Statistical Sciences and of the prospective supervisor. Not eligible for CR/NCR option._

### Prerequisite

At least 1.0 FCE 300+ level STA courses with a minimum grade of 80% in each course.

## Doing a reading course with _me_

First and foremost, here are some key things to know about my personal policies for reading courses:

- I only supervise the Fall to Winter ('year'-long), half credit version of this course.
- I do not supervise reading courses over the Spring/Summer semesters.
- I can only supervise a small number of students in a given year.
- You must come up with their own topic proposal in either __applied statistics__ or __statistics education__ to pitch to me.
- You must have completed STA303 and/or some form of TA/RA or other engagement (like the ISSC) with me to be eligible. Basically, when I see your application, you want for me to recognize your name.

__More information about applications coming soon.__
