## Academic year: 2021--22

In 2021-22 I will be teaching STA130 in the Fall, STA490 for the whole year and STA303 in the Winter.

-   R is the programming language used in these courses.

-   I tend to use and teach a lot of `tidyverse`, especially `dplyr` for data wrangling and `ggplot` for vizualization.

    -   If you're not familiar with these, consider checking out:

        -   chapters 3 and 5 of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham & Garret Grolemund, and

        -   the [DoSS Toolkit](https://dosstoolkit.com/), especially the modules ['Hand me my plyrs'](https://dosstoolkit.com/#hand-me-my-plyrs) and [To ggplot or not to ggplot](https://dosstoolkit.com/#to-ggplot-or-not-to-ggplot).

-   Delivery for STA490 and STA303 is subject to change due to the evolving pandemic situation, but **all assessments will be able to be completed and submitted online.** STA130 will remain online regardless as it is officially an online course.

-   I cannot add students to a course, waive prerequisites or move you off a waitlist. Please reach out to the UG stats team ([ug.statistics\@utoronto.ca](mailto:ug.statistics@utoronto.ca)) about questions of this nature.

    -   There will be ways for waitlisted STA130 & STA303 students to access course materials before the enrolment window closes, but you will not be able to complete assessments in this time. Both courses are designed to accommodate this.

-   Find my latest [autoresponder message post](https://blog.lizabolton.com/) for FAQs and other useful information.

-   Please note that while I try to ensure this page is accurate and up-to-date, it is in no way *official*. ACORN, official time table information and communications from the Department or Faculty are the most accurate sources of information. If they conflict with what is written here, believe *them*.
