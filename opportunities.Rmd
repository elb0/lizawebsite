Each summer these advertisements go up. I don't oversee the hiring, but I do love to know if you've applied and I am happy to answer questions about the course format and what the experience would be like. I can't answer questions about eligibility/visas etc.

There are also occasionally emergency postings outside of the usual summer recruitment drive.
