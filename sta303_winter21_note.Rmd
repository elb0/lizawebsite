If you're reading this, you may have been directed to this link by a former student of mine to provide you with more information about the project they completed in my course. This page doesn't have student specific information, but should give you a sense of the kinds of skills students who completed this project successfully will have.

## But first, some context

*STA303: Methods of Data Analysis II* is a course delivered by the [Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/).

In Winter semester 2021 (January to April), STA303 was run completely online due to COVID-19. Students rose to this challenge remarkably well, but it was a significant challenge to wellbeing and focus, none-the-less.

STA303 is a communication- and application-focused course where students learn: - to merge, wrangle, summarize and visualize data, - about several statistical modelling approaches and how to choose and implement these, as well as - how to write about their methods and results for a range of audiences.

The methods covered are: linear mixed models, generalized linear models, generalized linear mixed models and generalized additive models.

## Project task summary

I've included full information on this assessment at the end of this page, but it is not needed to understand it well. The project was worth 30% of their final grade and students could choose to complete it individually or as a team. Teamwork was recommended, but the task was the same either way. Team work was not mandated, as students had good reasons for completeing individually, such as being located in a challenging time zone, lack of access to interent appropriate for calling, or other caring or work obligations that made scheduling meetings untenable.

Students were consulting for Black Saber Software, analyzing their hiring and employee data and tasked with **creating a report appropriate for the Board of Directors on the topic of gender parity in hiring, wages and promotion**. Note: Black Saber isn't a real company, it would be massively reckless to provide 600 people with employee data with this level of detail. It would be very easy to identify individuals from data like this. That said, this dataset is based on real research and employment trends and draws on my own consulting experiences.

Each team or individual created a consulting company name, for the purposes of this activity and to register their group/individual status completed a pseudo-NDA, of which the only real part was reminding them that they had already agreed to several codes of conduct as part of their enrollment at U of T and made clear my expectations of their professionalism.

### The deliverable

The final submission was a report that included:

-   a cover page
-   an executive summary (2 pages max)
-   a technical report
-   consultant bio(s) and company ethics statement (note: these bios are meant to be 'fun' illustrations of their aspirations and interests and are not necessarily true).

They were tasked to answer the research questions posed by the client, communicate their fidnings in ways appropriate to the audiencse for each section of the report, choose appropriate methods and create professional visualisations and tables to explain their results.

Reports were written in a reproducible Rmd (a code and text file type popular for use with the programming language R). Students were provided with a basic template that they could choose to use.

### Skills demonstrated

Students who completed this project to a reasonable standard can do the following (organized under broad headings):

#### Statistical reasoning and knowledge

-   Develop relevant research questions that can be explored/answered statistically.

-   Merge large datasets programmatically and wrangle them appropriately to create meaningful new variables, where relevant.

-   Choose and create appropriate data visualizations and summaries.

-   Choose appropriate statistical models and check their assumptions.

-   Justify their choice of methods in writing.

-   Accurately describe results, including size and direction of effect through confidence intervals, where relevant.

-   Identify and discuss strengths and limitations of their statistical approaches.

#### Ethical professional practice

-   Understand and put into their own words aspects of the [Statistical Society of Canada Code of Ethical Statistical Practice](https://ssc.ca/sites/default/files/data/Members/public/Accreditation/ethics_e.pdf). (Demonstrated through the code of conduct they wrote for their 'company'.)

-   Report findings truthfully and accurately, even when they are not what the client 'wants to hear'.

-   Identify potential sources of algorithmic bias.

#### Writing

-   Write appropriately for different audiences, i.e. an executive summary for executives with limited statistical knowledge and a technical report for fellow analysts (though not necessarily ones familiar with R).

-   Format a report with a logical structure.

-   Work within length constraints to prioritize expressing the key information from a series of analyses.

#### Programming

-   Create reproducible code and suppress code appropriately in a final 'human-readable' report. I.e., no error outputs in the final PDF or raw variable names used.

-   Use data wrangling and visualization functions and packages (largely dplyr and ggplot2, if that means anything to you).

-   Comment on and organize their code logically.

#### Other

-   Construct and label tables and figures professionally.

-   Be resilient in the face of challenges, especially when it comes to troubleshooting code bugs.

-   Ask for help when they need it while also taking responsibility for their work.

While I would love to be able to otherwise, a busy final assessment period will **not** be sufficient reason to grant an extension.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
