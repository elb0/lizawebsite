## *Panel on teaching data-focused topics*, Toronto Data Workshop

*2020-12-17*

Big thank you to [Rohan Alexander](https://rohanalexander.com/) for organising this panel on teaching data-focussed topics. This was one of my favourite talks I've ever done because I got to get creative with it. Unfortunately my use of music kept getting Rohan copyright stuck on YouTube. Sorry, Rohan!

## *Everything you need to fall in love with Statistics*, an interview with [storyo.co](https://www.storyo.co/)

*2019-07-11*

> I met Liza (pronounced Lie-zuh, like Liza Minnelli) at the R-Ladies meetup in Auckland, New Zealand where she was giving a talk on colour palettes. If you ever meet Liza, you will see that it is absolutely impossible to not get a massive positive energy recharge after talking to her. Liza is currently doing her PhD in Statistics, running a consultancy called The Data Embassy, speaking at events, teaching, mentoring. It would be my absolute pleasure to learn more about Liza and share her wonderful story.
