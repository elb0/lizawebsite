## Panel on teaching data-focussed topics, Toronto Data Workshop


_2020-12-17_

Big thank you to [Rohan Alexander](https://rohanalexander.com/) for organising this panel on teaching data-focussed topics. This was one of my favourite talks I've ever done because I got to get creative with it. Unfortunately my use of music kept getting Rohan copyright stuck on YouTube. Sorry, Rohan!

My bit starts at 14:51 but I'd highly recommend the other speakers' sections!
