## ü§î That‚Äôs questionable: Designing and deploying effective models for generating multiple versions of auto-marked questions

*2024-12-02*

This is joint work with Anna Fergusson, Lars Thomsen, Charlotte Jones-Todd

### Abstract
Creating automatically marked question banks with a number of versions is popular for both supporting academic integrity and for providing low-stakes assessment opportunities with instant feedback. Short quizzes can engage students in checking their understanding throughout a course and support their preparation for higher-stakes assessments. While auto-marking can help reduce teaching team workload, the creation and maintenance of high-quality and fair question banks can be very demanding. To support this, a range of computational tools exist for creating auto-marked questions and deploying them to assessment platforms (e.g., the R package exams, Gr√ºn & Zeileis, 2009). However, while there is guidance for the practical implementation of these tools (e.g., Zeileis et al., 2014), there is very little documentation that explains the design process for developing models that can generate tens or even hundreds of versions of questions. This talk has three aims:
1) to explore design principles that support pedagogy-first approaches to creating question-generating models,
2) to share considerations and opportunities with respect to having students analyse data (with iNZight Lite) to answer quiz questions, and
3) to report on how students are actually using quizzes with multiple versions in a large introductory statistics course, including findings based on data about quiz attempts, as well as reflections from the teaching team.

## *This way or data-way: A survival guide for a world of data*, Raising the Bar Auckland

*2024-08-27*

Blurb: What do motivational posts on LinkedIn have in common with the supposedly small feet of Victorians? Join Dr Liza Bolton as she explores the habits of statistical thinking that can make our day-to-day lives better ‚Äì from picking a restaurant like a statistician, to why you shouldn‚Äôt necessarily believe a bus stop advertisement when it tells you your hometown is one of New Zealand‚Äôs most monogamous. There are no mathematics prerequisites here ‚Äì number lovers and loathers alike are invited on a romp through the good, the bad and the ugly from a world full of data and decisions.

Recorded at [Norma Taps](https://normataps.co.nz/), Auckland.

*2024-05-16*

Host: [Dr Sahir Hussain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sahir-hussain-b7a224190/)

### Description

The use of stats and throwing around numbers in conversation is incredibly common, yet statistics itself is poorly understood. Dr. Liza Bolton from  @universityofauckland discusses the dark art that is statistics. Using examples, she takes us through some misconceptions and dispels the notion that numbers don‚Äôt lie. We cover how to identify the best ice cream store, how to not be fooled when stats are mischaracterized in media and politics, why we worship the nat 20 dice roll and is the 27 club for musicians a real thing?

This is a short 'expert reaction' solicited by the Science Media Centre (NZ) on an published article about issues with, and an alternative to, reporting *per capita* measures. Thomas Lumley also commented, and his thoughts are always a good read!

Big thank you to [Rohan Alexander](https://rohanalexander.com/) for organising this panel on teaching data-focussed topics. This was one of my favourite talks I've ever done because I got to get creative with it. Unfortunately my use of music kept getting Rohan copyright stuck on YouTube. Sorry, Rohan!

## *Everything you need to fall in love with Statistics*, an interview with [storyo.co](https://www.storyo.co/)

*2019-07-11*

> I met Liza (pronounced Lie-zuh, like Liza Minnelli) at the R-Ladies meetup in Auckland, New Zealand where she was giving a talk on colour palettes. If you ever meet Liza, you will see that it is absolutely impossible to not get a massive positive energy recharge after talking to her. Liza is currently doing her PhD in Statistics, running a consultancy called The Data Embassy, speaking at events, teaching, mentoring. It would be my absolute pleasure to learn more about Liza and share her wonderful story.
