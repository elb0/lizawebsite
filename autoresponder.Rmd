I get a lot of emails. A lot of similar emails. So, I have an email auto-response on all-year round.

Below is a lightly reformatted version of my current message, just in case you find it easier to access here. Note: This is the version that is internal to U of T, there is a slightly different version for external emails.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi there,

Thanks for reaching out! I get a lot of the same questions from students, so to hopefully save everybody time, I have set up this automatic reply to address several frequently asked questions. You can also read a version of this message online [here](https://www.lizabolton.com/autoresponder.html).

[**If your email is answered by one of the topics covered below, please consider [this automatic reply]{.ul} my response. Please note that this is especially the case for references and graduate study inquiries.**]{style="background-color: #FFD700"}

If your question isn't related to the below, I will respond when I can. Please allow *at least* 24 hours, Monday--Friday, for a response before following up. Do not *expect* answers during evenings, weekends or holidays (Toronto time). I'm still teaching online this semester and that tends to come with a high volume of emails, please be patient with me and kind to yourself.

Best, \
Liza

-   **References**: I'm currently working with the undergraduate team to sort out an application process for asking me if I can be an academic referee for your grad school applications and logging the deadlines. I'm not *currently* saying yes or no until that is in place, but you can take a look at my personal policy [here](https://www.lizabolton.com/references.html) to get a sense of under what circumstances I could write for you under, but basically, a good mark in one class is not sufficient and you need to have at least two 'activities' with me. I'll add the link here and on the references page when it is available.

-   **Course enrolment:** I cannot add students to a course, waive prerequisites or move you off a waitlist. Please **reach out to the UG stats team ([ug.statistics\@utoronto.ca](ug.statistics@utoronto.ca))** about questions of this nature.

    -   For grad courses, please email [grad.statistics\@utoronto.ca](mailto:grad.statistics@utoronto.ca).

-   **If your email is about STA130**, please send it to [sta130\@utoronto.ca](mailto:sta130@utoronto.ca) instead, or, if you're an enrolled student and your question is about course content/logistics, please post it on Piazza (once the course is live). <span style="background-color: #FFD700">If you are on the **waitlist**, and would like to receive information about the course in the meantime, please fill out [this form](https://forms.office.com/r/iq2VrynHjk).</span> _Note: As stated above, I cannot add you to the course or influence the waitlist in any way._

    -   **STA130** is a completely online course (look for the '99' code in the section number. More information in the [Arts & Science FAQ](https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/covid19-artsci-student-faqs "https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/covid19-artsci-student-faqs").) All content and assessment will be accessed/completed online.

    -   **STA490** lectures will be online, and you will have a choice (subject to health advice) about whether you sign up for in-person or online project meeting sections. All assessments will be completed and submitted online.

    -   **STA303** will be a flipped course, with content delivered online and opportunities for activities both in-person (subject to health advice) and online. All assessments will be completed and submitted online.

    -   See also https://www.lizabolton.com/teaching.html. (Mostly just the same info as above).

-   **STA490 FAQs**

    -   *"Can I still apply for this course?"* Enrolment has closed for this course. Reach out to the UG stats team ([ug.statistics\@utoronto.ca](mailto:ug.statistics@utoronto.ca)) for more information.

    -   *"Can I select/swap the section I am enrolled in?"* Nope. Sections have been assigned based on the range of experiences and focus subjects among the selected students.

-   ***"**Can I have the the Winter 2022 **STA303/1002 syllabus?"***This syllabus is not available to students yet. You can see past versions and more information about the course on my [teaching page](https://www.lizabolton.com/teaching.html).

-   *"Where is your **office**?"*/*"Can I come see you in-person?"* At this stage, I cannot offer in-person office hours nor student meetings in my office. Drop-ins are not currently allowed for any instructors or TAs in Statistical Sciences, unless they have told you they have organized another meeting space for this purpose.

-   **Reading courses:** STA496: Readings in Statistics must be registered for as part of [special enrolment during July](https://utoronto.sharepoint.com/sites/ArtSci-STA/Undergrad/SitePages/Special-Enrolment-Courses--STA490Y1,-STA492H1-and-STA496H1-STA497H1.aspx "https://utoronto.sharepoint.com/sites/ArtSci-STA/Undergrad/SitePages/Special-Enrolment-Courses--STA490Y1,-STA492H1-and-STA496H1-STA497H1.aspx"). I will not be taking on any further students.

    -   If you're thinking about the future, I usually consider taking on a small number of STA496 students for a **half-credit, year long version.**

    -   There is much more information about my past students, research interests and what a course with me might be like on my website: https://www.lizabolton.com/reading_courses.html.
