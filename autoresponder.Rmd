I get a lot of emails. A lot of similar emails. So, I have an email auto-response on all-year round.

Below is a lightly reformatted version of my current message, just in case you find it easier to access here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi there,

Thanks for reaching out!

I get a lot of the same questions from students, so to hopefully save everybody time, I have set up this automatic reply to address several frequently asked questions. You can also read a version of this message online [here](https://www.lizabolton.com/autoresponder.html).

[**If your email is answered by one of the topics covered below, please consider [this automatic reply]{.underline} my response. Please note that this is especially the case for references and graduate study inquiries**]{style="background-color: #FFD700"}**---see the form and information below for requesting references.**

If your question isn't related to the below, I will respond when I can. Please allow *at least* 48 hours, Monday--Friday, for a response before following up.

Best,\
Liza

-   **Graduate school references:** Please read my personal policy [here](https://www.lizabolton.com/references.html) to get a sense of under what circumstances I could write for you. Basically, a good mark in one class is *not* sufficient for me to be able to write a letter that will strengthen your application. *"Why yes, according to their transcript this student did take my course"* isn't a very inspiring recommendation. My basic criteria is that you need to **have at least two distinct 'activities' with me**. If you believe you meet this basic criteria, you can request a reference from me [here](https://forms.office.com/r/XHqjGXjCru). I will then accept or decline based on the information provided.

-   **2022-23 teaching & supervision**

    -   I will be teaching the Winter semester of STA490 this year. I will not be teaching STA130 or STA303. You can find Winter 2022 STA303 resources [here](https://sta303-bolton.github.io/sta303-w22-courseguide/ "https://sta303-bolton.github.io/sta303-w22-courseguide/"), but please note that the course is likely to be improved and run differently by its next instructor.

    -   I will not be supervising any **reading courses,** but highly recommend strong final year students look into them. Reach out to [ug.statistics\@utoronto.ca](mailto:ug.statistics@utoronto.ca "ug.statistics@utoronto.ca")for more information.

-   **Research/work study/teaching assistant opportunities:**

    -   See the [Department website](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/employment-opportunities/cupe-positions-unit-1 "https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/employment-opportunities/cupe-positions-unit-1"). The main round of TA recruitment occurs during the summer but there are occasionally emergency postings.

    -   Any current opportunities (with me or occasionally colleagues I'm promoting for) will be listed here: <https://www.lizabolton.com/opportunities.html>.

-   Looking for a **project** to build up your **portfolio**?

    -   Try a previous STA303 final project:

        -   2021: Consulting for fake company Black Saber Software, analyzing their hiring and employee data and creating a report appropriate for the Board of Directors on the topic of gender parity in hiring, wages and promotion. See [here](https://www.lizabolton.com/sta303_winter21_note "https://www.lizabolton.com/sta303_winter21_note") for client emails, other info, and how to get the data (see bottom of page).

        -   2022: Consulting for fake company MINGAR, analyzing customer data for their Canadian fitness tracker/watch market and investigating a concern about poorer product performance for users with darker skin. This project also includes some modern data skills, like accessing an API to retrieve a large volume of data, scraping a table from a website into a usable dataset and using a licensed postal code conversion file for data linkage. See the [client email](https://sta303-bolton.github.io/sta303-w22-final-project/emails.html "https://sta303-bolton.github.io/sta303-w22-final-project/emails.html") and [general info](https://sta303-bolton.github.io/sta303-w22-final-project/ "https://sta303-bolton.github.io/sta303-w22-final-project/") (Step 5 might be most helpful), and access the data and template on [JupyterHub](https://sta303-bolton.github.io/sta303-w22-final-project/hints.html "https://sta303-bolton.github.io/sta303-w22-final-project/hints.html") (U of T only) or [GitHub](https://github.com/sta303-bolton/sta303-w22-final-project-template "https://github.com/sta303-bolton/sta303-w22-final-project-template").

    -   I also always recommend [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) datasets and you may find Chapter 4 of [Building a Career in Data Science](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-career-in-data-science) interesting (the authors have made it available for free on that website).

-   **Masters/PhDs:** I am not taking on Masters or PhD students. Please see the graduate section of our Department website for more information: <https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/graduate>.

    -   Prospective PhD students, all applications are made through a [central portal](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/graduate/phd-application-information "https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/graduate/phd-application-information"), you don't (to my knowledge) need a sponsoring faculty member, but can check out the team [here](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty?sort_by=ppl_last_name_value&items_per_page=All "https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty?sort_by=ppl_last_name_value&items_per_page=All"). You will be able to select up to three potential supervisors at the time of your application (but again note that I'm not taking on students).
