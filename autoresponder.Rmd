I get a lot of emails. A lot of similar emails. So, I have an email auto-response on all-year round.

Below is a lightly reformatted version of my current message, just in case you find it easier to access here. Note: This is the version that is internal to U of T, there is a slightly different version for external emails.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi there,

Thanks for reaching out! I get a lot of the same questions from students, so to hopefully save everybody time, I have set up this automatic reply to address several frequently asked questions. You can also read a version of this message online [here](https://www.lizabolton.com/autoresponder.html).

[**If your email is answered by one of the topics covered below, please consider [this automatic reply]{.underline} my response. Please note that this is especially the case for references and graduate study inquiries**]{style="background-color: #FFD700"}**---see the form and information below for requesting references.**

If your question isn't related to the below, I will respond when I can. Please allow *at least* 24 hours, Monday--Friday, for a response before following up. Please do not *expect* answers during evenings, weekends or holidays (Toronto time).

Best,\
Liza

-   **Final grades**: We **do not** do ad hoc final grade adjustments unless we have made a *mistake* in your calculation. It is not appropriate to request we change your grade just because you want a higher one, or because you're close to a certain GPA threshold or program requirement.

-   **Graduate school references:** Please read my personal policy [here](https://www.lizabolton.com/references.html) to get a sense of under what circumstances I could write for you, but basically, a good mark in one class is not sufficient and you need to have at least two 'activities' with me. If you believe you meet my basic criteria, you can request a reference from me [here](https://forms.office.com/r/XHqjGXjCru). I will then accept or decline based on the the information provided.

-   **If your email is about STA303,** please send it to [sta303\@utoronto.ca](mailto:sta303@utoronto.ca "mailto:sta303@utoronto.ca") instead, or, if you're an enrolled student and your question is about course content/logistics, please post it on Piazza. Messages that do not follow the [communication policy](https://sta303-bolton.github.io/sta303-w22-courseguide/syllabus.html#communication-policy "https://sta303-bolton.github.io/sta303-w22-courseguide/syllabus.html#communication-policy") will not be responded to.

-   **No 2022-23 teaching & supervision**

    -   I will be away for research and not teaching during the 2022-23 academic year.

    -   I will not be supervising any **reading courses,** but highly recommend strong final year students look into them. *STA496/497: Readings in Statistics* must be registered for as part of [special enrolment during \~July](https://utoronto.sharepoint.com/sites/ArtSci-STA/Undergrad/SitePages/Special-Enrolment-Courses--STA490Y1,-STA492H1-and-STA496H1-STA497H1.aspx "https://utoronto.sharepoint.com/sites/ArtSci-STA/Undergrad/SitePages/Special-Enrolment-Courses--STA490Y1,-STA492H1-and-STA496H1-STA497H1.aspx") (Sharepoint to be updated).

-   **Research/work study/teaching assistant opportunities:**

    -   See the [Department website](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/employment-opportunities/cupe-positions-unit-1 "https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/employment-opportunities/cupe-positions-unit-1"). The main round of TA recruitment occurs during the summer but there are occasionally emergency postings.

-   **Masters/PhDs:** I am not taking on Masters or PhD students. Please see the graduate section of our Department website for more information: <https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/graduate>.
