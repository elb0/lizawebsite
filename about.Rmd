Hello and kia ora! 

__How do you pronounce my name?__ ![Google's pronunciation for Liza Koshy is the same as mine. Search "pronounce liza" if you want to hear it.](images/pronunciation.png){width=100% .external}

My last name is Bolton (__bowl__Â·tn), and the pronunciation Google provides is correct for that, too.
