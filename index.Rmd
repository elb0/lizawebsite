Hello and kia ora! 

I'm a statistics enthusiast and Assistant Professor, Teaching Stream in the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto, Canada.

I grew up between Canada and New Zealand and so sometimes my slang is confusing.

#### Do you have to talk to or about me for some reason? Here are some things that might be useful to know:

* What are my pronouns? she/her 
* How do you pronounce my name?
  * Google's pronunciation for Liza Koshy is the same as mine. Search "pronounce liza" if you want to hear it.

  * My last name is Bolton (__bowl__Â·tn), and the pronunciation Google provides is correct for that, too.
