Hello and kia ora! 

# This site is still under construction! Only proceed if you are wearing a hard hat.

I'm a statistics enthusiast and Assistant Professor, Teaching Stream in the [Department of Statistical Sciences](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto, Canada.

I grew up between Canada and New Zealand and so sometimes my slang is confusing.

#### Do you have to talk to or about me for some reason? Here are some things that might be useful to know:

* What are my __pronouns__? she/her 
* How do you __pronounce__ my name?
  * Google's pronunciation for Liza Koshy is the same as mine. Search "pronounce liza" if you want to hear it.

  * My last name is Bolton (__bowl__Â·tn), and the pronunciation Google provides is correct for that, too.
